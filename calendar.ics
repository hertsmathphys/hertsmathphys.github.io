SUMMARY:Yang-Hui He 何杨辉 (University of Oxford; City, University of London), The AI mathematician: from physics, to geometry, to number theory
DESCRIPTION:We summarize how AI can approach mathematics in three ways: theorem‐proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and string theory, we present a number of recent experiments on how various standard machine‐learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines ranging from algebraic geometry to representation theory, to combinatorics, and to number theory. At the heart of the programme is the question: how does AI help with mathematical discovery?

SUMMARY:Joost Nuiten (Université Toulouse Ⅲ Paul Sabatier), The Van Est isomorphism for higher stacks
DESCRIPTION:A classical theorem of Van Est relates the differentiable cohomology of a Lie group to the cohomology of its Lie algebra. I will discuss a version of this result for homotopy‐theoretic variants of Lie group(oid)s, such as the string group, relating their cohomology to the cohomology of their (higher) Lie algebroids. The main challenge is to provide a well‐behaved analogue of Lie differentiation for higher groupoids; I will discuss how one can use ideas from Lurie and Pridham to provide such a construction.

SUMMARY:Daniel Waldram (Imperial College London), 𝑎‐maximisation and slope stability in generalised geometry
DESCRIPTION:𝑎‐maximisation is a key property of 4d superconformal field theories that allows one to find the 𝑅‐symmetry and central charge. Understanding the generic gravitational dual of this process is a key question in holography. I will describe some work in progress with Anthony Ashmore, Stephanie Baines and Michela Petrini, where we argue that it can be understood in terms of a notion of slope stability for AdS backgrounds in generalised geometry, in a way that physically connects closely to renormalisation group flow. For simplicity we will focus on the special case of Sasaki–Einstein geometries, where, using SL(𝑛+1) generalised geometry, one reproduces (and extends) the volume minimisation procedure of Martelli–Sparks–Yau. Very broadly one can view the dual field theory and generalised geometry formulations as algebraic and differential descriptions of the same underlying geometry.

SUMMARY:Lukas Müller (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics), Topological defects
DESCRIPTION:Recently, the study of higher categories of topological defects in quantum field theory has gained significant attention due to their connection to categorical symmetries. These higher categories exhibit noteworthy additional structures, depending upon the specific theories and defects under consideration. For instance, in oriented 2‐dimensional field theories, they organize into a pivotal bicategory. Currently, we lack a comprehensive framework to systematically describe these intricate structures. In my talk I will argue that the theory of higher dagger categories provides such a framework. The talk is partially based on joint work in progress with Gio Ferrer, Brett Hungar, Theo Johnson‐Freyd, Cameron Krulewski, Nivedita, Dave Penneys, David Reutter, Claudia Scheimbauer, Luuk Stehouwer, and Chetan Vuppulury.

SUMMARY:Pavol Ševera (Université de Genève), On non‐topological boundary conditions of (perturbative) topological field theories
DESCRIPTION:In Witten’s CS/WZW correspondence the chiral WZW model appears from the chiral boundary condition imposed on the CS theory. I will describe how similar boundary conditions of the CStheory and of its analogs (given by the AKSZ constructions) produce many other interesting examples and how they explain, in particular, Poisson–Lie 𝑇‐duality. Unlike the CS/WZW correspondence, this generalization is only perturbative; on the other hand, the perturbative renormalization leads to the generalized Ricci tensor and hopefully still hides many interesting things. Based on joint works with J. Pulmann, F. Valach, and D. Youmans.

SUMMARY:Bruno Giménez Umbert (University of Southampton, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics), 𝜙𝑝 amplitudes from the positive tropical Grassmannian
DESCRIPTION:The global Schwinger formula, introduced by Cachazo and Early as a single integral over the positive tropical Grassmannian, provides a way to uncover properties of scattering amplitudes which are hard to see in their standard Feynman diagram formulation. In this talk I will review how partial biadjoint scalar amplitudes are computed using the global Schwinger formula, and also how one can recover amplitudes from it by using a limiting procedure on the kinematic invariants. Moreover, I will show how the regions in the positive tropical Grassmannian contributing to amplitudes are obtained from non-crossing (𝑝−2)‐chord diagrams, which can be extended to objects whose triangulations are in bijection with Feynman diagrams. Finally, I will point out a connection between these extended diagrams and off‐diagonal partial amplitudes, implying that  amplitudes can be expressed as a sum of products of cubic amplitudes.

SUMMARY:Hyungrok Kim 김형록 (University of Hertfordshire), A witty title containing ‘homotopy algebras’, ‘scattering amplitudes’, ‘holography’ and ‘Schwinger–Keldysh’, such as this one
DESCRIPTION:Abstract: ‘Give a child a hammer, and they will treat everything like a nail.’ As a child, the speaker was given homological perturbation theory (HPT) of 𝐿∞‐algebras, and he thus treats every perturbation theory as an instance of HPT. In particular, he will show how HPT naturally produces the Feynman diagrams of 𝑆‐matrices, the Witten diagrams of AdS/CFT, the cut diagrams of non‐time‐ordered Schwinger–Keldysh observables (as in the recent work by Caron‐Huot et al.) and more. He begs pardon for referring to himself in the third person. Based on ongoing joint work with Leron Borsten, David Simon Henrik Jonsson, Martin Wolf and (last but not least) Charles Alistair Stephen Young.

SUMMARY:Ján Pullman (Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann), Lagrangian relations, half‐densities and quantum 𝐿∞ algebras
DESCRIPTION:Lagrangian relations model maps and more general correspondences between physical systems. In Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism, it is natural to generalize Lagrangian relations to distributional half‐densities, as advocated by Ševera. We give a rigorous definition of linear distributional half‐densities and describe their composition, thus constructing a linear version of a quantum odd symplectic category. As an application, we describe the computation of the BV effective action as a composition in this category. Based on [arXiv:2401.06110], joint with B. Jurčo and M. Zika.

SUMMARY:Carlos Shahbazi (Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia), The Heterotic‐Ricci flow and its three‐dimensional solitons
DESCRIPTION:I will introduce a novel curvature flow, the Heterotic‐Ricci flow, as the two‐loop renormalization group flow of the Heterotic string common sector and study its three‐dimensional compact solitons. The Heterotic‐Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non‐negative real parameter 𝜅, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three‐form 𝐻 on a manifold 𝑀. Its most salient feature is that it involves a term quadratic in the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew‐symmetric torsion 𝐻. When 𝜅=0 the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as an extension of the latter via a higher order correction prescribed by string theory, whereas when 𝐻=0 and 𝜅&gt;0 the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG‐2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three‐form 𝐻. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of self‐similar solutions of the Heterotic‐Ricci flow. I will present several structural results for three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons, providing the complete classification of three‐dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left‐invariant metric. Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‐constant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‐constant dilaton. Work in collaboration with Andrei Moroianu (Paris).

SUMMARY:Donal O’Connell (Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann), Amplitudes and waveforms
DESCRIPTION:Waveforms are the most important precision observables in modern studies of general relativity. I will discuss how waveforms in gravitational scattering are closely very related to scattering amplitudes. The computation of next‐to‐leading order waveforms has revealed a number of interesting aspects of this connection, including generalisations of amplitudes, BMS dependence of the waveform, and the importance of a new class of functions involving iterated integrals of Bessel functions.

SUMMARY:Silvia Nagy (Durham University), Asymptotic symmetries for subleading soft theorems
DESCRIPTION:It is by now well understood how leading soft theorems follow as Ward identities of asymptotic symmetries defined at null infinity. For subleading infrared effects the connection is more subtle, but it turns out that this can be formalised, to all orders, by adapting the Stueckelberg procedure to construct an extended radiative phase space at null infinity. I will show this at all orders for self‐dual Yang–Mills, self‐dual gravity, and finally Yang–Mills.

SUMMARY:Severin Bunk (University of Hertfordshire), Infinitesimal higher symmetries
DESCRIPTION:Every bundle on a manifold has a universal symmetry group: for any Lie group 𝐺, giving a 𝐺‐equivariant structure on the bundle is equivalent to giving a Lie group homomorphism from 𝐺 to this universal symmetry group. The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher U(1)‐bundles, or 𝑛‐gerbes. This is joint work with Lukas Müller, Joost Nuiten and Richard Szabo.

SUMMARY:Javier José Murgas Ibarra (Universitetet i Stavanger), A heterotic Kodaira–Spencer theory
DESCRIPTION:Taking extrema of the six‐dimensional heterotic superpotential gives the so‐called 𝐹‐term constraints of the Hull–Strominger system. Starting at a solution, one can consider ‘off‐shell’ fluctuations of the structure in the superpotential. This gives rise to a theory with similar features to Kodaira–Spencer gravity. A natural next step is then to quantise this theory. I will discuss the computation of the one‐loop partition function and find it can be expressed as a product of holomorphic Ray–Singer torsions. Finally, I will discuss its potential metric anomaly.

SUMMARY:Julian Mateo Kupka (University of Hertfordshire), Non‐relativistic geometry and why you might care
DESCRIPTION:This talk explores non‐relativistic geometry, a mathematical framework allowing us to formulate Newtonian physics analogously to General Relativity, i.e. geometrizing it. We will build the geometry and theory from the ground up and explain how exactly it encodes Newtonian gravity in a diffeomorphism invariant fashion. We will then connect it to null reductions, which allows us to relate non‐relativistic to relativistic physics with a special null direction, highlighting why you might encounter it in your applications.

SUMMARY:Nick Early (Max‐Planck‐Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften), Scattering amplitudes and tilings of moduli spaces
DESCRIPTION:In 2013, Cachazo, He and Yuan (CHY) discovered a remarkable framework for scattering amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which mixes the real, complex and tropical geometry associated to the moduli space of 𝑛 points on the projective line, ℳ0,𝑛.  By duality, this moduli space has a twin moduli space of 𝑛 generic points in ℙ𝑛−3, leading to dual realization of scattering amplitudes, using a generalization of the CHY formalism introduced in 2019 by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM).  Any duality begs for an investigation: what structures lie between the twin moduli spaces?  CEGM developed a framework to answer the question for moduli spaces of 𝑛 points in any ℙ𝑘−1, leading to the discovery of rich, recursive structures which seem to suggest a new frontier in the study of scattering amplitudes.  In this talk, we discuss recent joint work with Cachazo and Zhang which uses ideas from oriented matroids to construct color-dressed generalized biadjoint scalar amplitudes.

SUMMARY:Ricardo Monteiro (Queen Mary University of London), On helicity violation in Yang–Mills and gravity
DESCRIPTION:I will discuss topics related to helicity violation in Yang–Mills and gravity. Firstly, I will discuss the connection of helicity violation, well known from the context of scattering amplitudes, to the concept of electric–magnetic duality — and in particular to its failure. Secondly, I will focus on the self‐dual sectors of Yang–Mills and gravity. These sectors satisfy classically a version of the electric–magnetic duality, but this symmetry is anomalous, giving rise to the all‐plus one‐loop amplitudes. Finally, I will discuss some lessons and intriguing aspects.

DESCRIPTION:Feynman integrals are the core of theoretical physics predictions for collider experiments, and at the same time exhibit remarkably deep mathematical structure. In this talk, I will describe how the knowledge of their singularities, as captured by the Landau equations, may aid the formidable task of their evaluation much more than was previously expected. In particular, I will provide evidence that the latter equations capture the building blocks or ‘letters’ of the integrals, when recast as a polynomial of their variables known as the principal 𝐴‐determinant.

SUMMARY:Ömer Gürdoğan (University of Southampton), Antipodal dualities: reading form factors backwards
DESCRIPTION:Our understanding of scattering amplitudes is in a process of perpetual refinement where new results lead to new insights, which in turn enable even more ambitious calculations. I will report on a recent observation that certain amplitudes and form factors are mapped to each other under the antipode of the Hopf algebra of multiple polylogarithms. This observation is based on an eight‐loop calculation of form factors, which turns out to be very amenable to the symbol bootstrap approach.

SUMMARY:Benjamin Hoare (Durham University), Diamonds of integrable deformations
DESCRIPTION:There are two well‐known origins of 2‐dimensional integrable QFTs from 4 dimensions — localisation of 4d Chern–Simons and symmetry reduction of 4d anti‐self‐dual Yang–Mills. It is a conjecture of Costello that these can be unified in a diamond of theories, starting from holomorphic Chern–Simons theory in 6 dimensions.
It has been shown how this works for the simplest class of theories, including the principal chiral model with a Wess–Zumino term, by Bittleston and Skinner. In this talk I will discuss what happens if we try to deform and explore the new features that appear, including the role of novel boundary conditions in 4d Chern–Simons.
This talk is based on work with Lewis Cole, Ryan Cullinan, Joaquín Liniado and Dan Thompson.

SUMMARY:Leron Borsten (University of Hertfordshire), Higher symmetries and homotopy algebras: scattering amplitudes, colour–kinematics duality, 𝐿∞‐ and BV∞◽️‐algebras, the double copy and M2‐branes models
DESCRIPTION:The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: Einstein=Yang—Mills squared!
Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or 𝐿∞‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket [–,–] Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary [–] and ternary bracket [–,–,–], which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.
We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical 𝑆‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy BV◽️‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the BLG and ABJM M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality.
