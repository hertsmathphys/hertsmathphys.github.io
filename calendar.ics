SUMMARY:Yang‚ÄêHui He ‰ΩïÊù®Ëæâ (University of Oxford; City, University of London), The AI mathematician: from physics, to geometry, to number theory
DESCRIPTION:We summarize how AI can approach mathematics in three ways: theorem‚Äêproving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and string theory, we present a number of recent experiments on how various standard machine‚Äêlearning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines ranging from algebraic geometry to representation theory, to combinatorics, and to number theory. At the heart of the programme is the question: how does AI help with mathematical discovery?

SUMMARY:Joost Nuiten (Universit√© Toulouse ‚Ö¢ Paul Sabatier), The Van Est isomorphism for higher stacks
DESCRIPTION:A classical theorem of Van Est relates the differentiable cohomology of a Lie group to the cohomology of its Lie algebra. I will discuss a version of this result for homotopy‚Äêtheoretic variants of Lie group(oid)s, such as the string group, relating their cohomology to the cohomology of their (higher) Lie algebroids. The main challenge is to provide a well‚Äêbehaved analogue of Lie differentiation for higher groupoids; I will discuss how one can use ideas from Lurie and Pridham to provide such a construction.

SUMMARY:Eirik Eik Svanes (Universitetet i Stavanger), Heterotic distance conjectures and symplectic cohomology
DESCRIPTION:Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form.

SUMMARY:Daniel Waldram (Imperial College London), ùëé‚Äêmaximisation and slope stability in generalised geometry
DESCRIPTION:ùëé‚Äêmaximisation is a key property of 4d superconformal field theories that allows one to find the ùëÖ‚Äêsymmetry and central charge. Understanding the generic gravitational dual of this process is a key question in holography. I will describe some work in progress with Anthony Ashmore, Stephanie Baines and Michela Petrini, where we argue that it can be understood in terms of a notion of slope stability for AdS backgrounds in generalised geometry, in a way that physically connects closely to renormalisation group flow. For simplicity we will focus on the special case of Sasaki‚ÄìEinstein geometries, where, using SL‚Å°(ùëõ+1) generalised geometry, one reproduces (and extends) the volume minimisation procedure of Martelli‚ÄìSparks‚ÄìYau. Very broadly one can view the dual field theory and generalised geometry formulations as algebraic and differential descriptions of the same underlying geometry.

SUMMARY:Lukas M√ºller (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics), Topological defects
DESCRIPTION:Recently, the study of higher categories of topological defects in quantum field theory has gained significant attention due to their connection to categorical symmetries. These higher categories exhibit noteworthy additional structures, depending upon the specific theories and defects under consideration. For instance, in oriented 2‚Äêdimensional field theories, they organize into a pivotal bicategory. Currently, we lack a comprehensive framework to systematically describe these intricate structures. In my talk I will argue that the theory of higher dagger categories provides such a framework. The talk is partially based on joint work in progress with Gio Ferrer, Brett Hungar, Theo Johnson‚ÄêFreyd, Cameron Krulewski, Nivedita, Dave Penneys, David Reutter, Claudia Scheimbauer, Luuk Stehouwer, and Chetan Vuppulury.

SUMMARY:Pavol ≈†evera (Universit√© de Gen√®ve), On non‚Äêtopological boundary conditions of (perturbative) topological field theories
DESCRIPTION:In Witten‚Äôs CS/WZW correspondence the chiral WZW model appears from the chiral boundary condition imposed on the CS theory. I will describe how similar boundary conditions of the CS theory and of its analogs (given by the AKSZ constructions) produce many other interesting examples and how they explain, in particular, Poisson‚ÄìLie ùëá‚Äêduality. Unlike the CS/WZW correspondence, this generalization is only perturbative; on the other hand, the perturbative renormalization leads to the generalized Ricci tensor and hopefully still hides many interesting things. Based on joint works with J. Pulmann, F. Valach, and D. Youmans.

SUMMARY:Bruno Gim√©nez Umbert (University of Southampton, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics), ùúôùëù amplitudes from the positive tropical Grassmannian
DESCRIPTION:The global Schwinger formula, introduced by Cachazo and Early as a single integral over the positive tropical Grassmannian, provides a way to uncover properties of scattering amplitudes which are hard to see in their standard Feynman diagram formulation. In this talk I will review how partial biadjoint scalar amplitudes are computed using the global Schwinger formula, and also how one can recover amplitudes from it by using a limiting procedure on the kinematic invariants. Moreover, I will show how the regions in the positive tropical Grassmannian contributing to amplitudes are obtained from non-crossing (ùëù‚àí2)‚Äêchord diagrams, which can be extended to objects whose triangulations are in bijection with Feynman diagrams. Finally, I will point out a connection between these extended diagrams and off‚Äêdiagonal partial amplitudes, implying that  amplitudes can be expressed as a sum of products of cubic amplitudes.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: ‚ÄòGive a child a hammer, and they will treat everything like a nail.‚Äô As a child, the speaker was given homological perturbation theory (HPT) of ùêø‚àû‚Äêalgebras, and he thus treats every perturbation theory as an instance of HPT.

SUMMARY:J√°n Pullman (Oilthigh Dh√πn √àideann), Lagrangian relations, half‚Äêdensities and quantum ùêø‚àû algebras
DESCRIPTION:Lagrangian relations model maps and more general correspondences between physical systems. In Batalin‚ÄìVilkovisky formalism, it is natural to generalize Lagrangian relations to distributional half‚Äêdensities, as advocated by ≈†evera. We give a rigorous definition of linear distributional half‚Äêdensities and describe their composition, thus constructing a linear version of a quantum odd symplectic category. As an application, we describe the computation of the BV effective action as a composition in this category. Based on [arXiv:2401.06110], joint with B. Jurƒço and M. Zika.

SUMMARY:Carlos Shahbazi (Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia), The Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow and its three‚Äêdimensional solitons
DESCRIPTION:I will introduce a novel curvature flow, the Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow, as the two‚Äêloop renormalization group flow of the Heterotic string common sector and study its three‚Äêdimensional compact solitons. The Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non‚Äênegative real parameter ùúÖ, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three‚Äêform ùêª on a manifold ùëÄ. Its most salient feature is that it involves a term quadratic in the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew‚Äêsymmetric torsion ùêª. When ùúÖ=0 the Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as an extension of the latter via a higher order correction prescribed by string theory, whereas when ùêª=0 and ùúÖ&gt;0 the Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG‚Äê2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three‚Äêform ùêª. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of self‚Äêsimilar solutions of the Heterotic‚ÄêRicci flow. I will present several structural results for three‚Äêdimensional Heterotic solitons, providing the complete classification of three‚Äêdimensional strong Heterotic solitons as quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left‚Äêinvariant metric. Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‚Äêdimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‚Äêconstant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‚Äêconstant dilaton. Work in collaboration with Andrei Moroianu (Paris).

SUMMARY:Donal O‚ÄôConnell (Oilthigh Dh√πn √àideann), Amplitudes and waveforms
DESCRIPTION:Waveforms are the most important precision observables in modern studies of general relativity. I will discuss how waveforms in gravitational scattering are closely very related to scattering amplitudes. The computation of next‚Äêto‚Äêleading order waveforms has revealed a number of interesting aspects of this connection, including generalisations of amplitudes, BMS dependence of the waveform, and the importance of a new class of functions involving iterated integrals of Bessel functions.

SUMMARY:Silvia Nagy (Durham University), Asymptotic symmetries for subleading soft theorems
DESCRIPTION:It is by now well understood how leading soft theorems follow as Ward identities of asymptotic symmetries defined at null infinity. For subleading infrared effects the connection is more subtle, but it turns out that this can be formalised, to all orders, by adapting the Stueckelberg procedure to construct an extended radiative phase space at null infinity. I will show this at all orders for self‚Äêdual Yang‚ÄìMills, self‚Äêdual gravity, and finally Yang‚ÄìMills.

SUMMARY:Severin Bunk (University of Hertfordshire), Infinitesimal higher symmetries
DESCRIPTION:Every bundle on a manifold has a universal symmetry group: for any Lie group ùê∫, giving a ùê∫‚Äêequivariant structure on the bundle is equivalent to giving a Lie group homomorphism from ùê∫ to this universal symmetry group. The existence of non‚Äêtrivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‚Äêversion of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher U(1)‚Äêbundles, or ùëõ‚Äêgerbes. This is joint work with Lukas M√ºller, Joost Nuiten and Richard Szabo.

SUMMARY:Javier Jos√© Murgas Ibarra (Universitetet i Stavanger), A heterotic Kodaira‚ÄìSpencer theory
DESCRIPTION:Taking extrema of the six‚Äêdimensional heterotic superpotential gives the so‚Äêcalled ùêπ‚Äêterm constraints of the Hull‚ÄìStrominger system. Starting at a solution, one can consider ‚Äòoff‚Äêshell‚Äô fluctuations of the structure in the superpotential. This gives rise to a theory with similar features to Kodaira‚ÄìSpencer gravity. A natural next step is then to quantise this theory. I will discuss the computation of the one‚Äêloop partition function and find it can be expressed as a product of holomorphic Ray‚ÄìSinger torsions. Finally, I will discuss its potential metric anomaly.

SUMMARY:Julian Mateo Kupka (University of Hertfordshire), Non‚Äêrelativistic geometry and why you might care
DESCRIPTION:This talk explores non‚Äêrelativistic geometry, a mathematical framework allowing us to formulate Newtonian physics analogously to General Relativity, i.e. geometrizing it. We will build the geometry and theory from the ground up and explain how exactly it encodes Newtonian gravity in a diffeomorphism invariant fashion. We will then connect it to null reductions, which allows us to relate non‚Äêrelativistic to relativistic physics with a special null direction, highlighting why you might encounter it in your applications.

SUMMARY:Nick Early (Max‚ÄêPlanck‚ÄêInstitut f√ºr Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften), Scattering amplitudes and tilings of moduli spaces
DESCRIPTION:In 2013, Cachazo, He and Yuan (CHY) discovered a remarkable framework for scattering amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which mixes the real, complex and tropical geometry associated to the moduli space of ùëõ points on the projective line, ‚Ñ≥0,ùëõ.  By duality, this moduli space has a twin moduli space of ùëõ generic points in ‚Ñôùëõ‚àí3, leading to dual realization of scattering amplitudes, using a generalization of the CHY formalism introduced in 2019 by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM).  Any duality begs for an investigation: what structures lie between the twin moduli spaces?  CEGM developed a framework to answer the question for moduli spaces of ùëõ points in any ‚Ñôùëò‚àí1, leading to the discovery of rich, recursive structures which seem to suggest a new frontier in the study of scattering amplitudes.  In this talk, we discuss recent joint work with Cachazo and Zhang which uses ideas from oriented matroids to construct color-dressed generalized biadjoint scalar amplitudes.

DESCRIPTION:I will discuss topics related to helicity violation in Yang‚ÄìMills and gravity. Firstly, I will discuss the connection of helicity violation, well known from the context of scattering amplitudes, to the concept of electric‚Äìmagnetic duality ‚Äî and in particular to its failure. Secondly, I will focus on the self‚Äêdual sectors of Yang‚ÄìMills and gravity. These sectors satisfy classically a version of the electric‚Äìmagnetic duality, but this symmetry is anomalous, giving rise to the all‚Äêplus one‚Äêloop amplitudes. Finally, I will discuss some lessons and intriguing aspects.

DESCRIPTION:Feynman integrals are the core of theoretical physics predictions for collider experiments, and at the same time exhibit remarkably deep mathematical structure. In this talk, I will describe how the knowledge of their singularities, as captured by the Landau equations, may aid the formidable task of their evaluation much more than was previously expected.

SUMMARY:√ñmer G√ºrdoƒüan (University of Southampton), Antipodal dualities: reading form factors backwards
DESCRIPTION:Our understanding of scattering amplitudes is in a process of perpetual refinement where new results lead to new insights, which in turn enable even more ambitious calculations. I will report on a recent observation that certain amplitudes and form factors are mapped to each other under the antipode of the Hopf algebra of multiple polylogarithms. This observation is based on an eight‚Äêloop calculation of form factors, which turns out to be very amenable to the symbol bootstrap approach.

SUMMARY:Benjamin Hoare (Durham University), Diamonds of integrable deformations
DESCRIPTION:There are two well‚Äêknown origins of 2‚Äêdimensional integrable QFTs from 4 dimensions ‚Äî localisation of 4d Chern‚ÄìSimons and symmetry reduction of 4d anti‚Äêself‚Äêdual Yang‚ÄìMills. It is a conjecture of Costello that these can be unified in a diamond of theories, starting from holomorphic Chern‚ÄìSimons theory in 6 dimensions.
It has been shown how this works for the simplest class of theories, including the principal chiral model with a Wess‚ÄìZumino term, by Bittleston and Skinner. In this talk I will discuss what happens if we try to deform and explore the new features that appear, including the role of novel boundary conditions in 4d Chern‚ÄìSimons.
This talk is based on work with Lewis Cole, Ryan Cullinan, Joaqu√≠n Liniado and Dan Thompson.

SUMMARY:Leron Borsten (University of Hertfordshire), Higher symmetries and homotopy algebras: scattering amplitudes, colour‚Äìkinematics duality, ùêø‚àû‚Äê and BV‚àû‚óΩÔ∏è‚Äêalgebras, the double copy and M2‚Äêbranes models
DESCRIPTION:The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour‚Äìkinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang‚ÄìMills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the ‚Äúdouble copy‚Äù of amplitudes: Einstein=Yang‚ÄìMills squared!
Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie‚Ä¶) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or ùêø‚àû‚Äêalgebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket [‚Äì,‚Äì] Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary [‚Äì] and ternary bracket [‚Äì,‚Äì,‚Äì], which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.
We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour‚Äìkinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin‚ÄìVilkovisky action: assuming tree‚Äêlevel colour‚Äìkinematics duality of the physical ùëÜ‚Äêmatrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour‚Äìkinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the ‚Äúcolour‚Äêstripped‚Äù homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy BV‚óΩÔ∏è‚Äêalgebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‚Äêlevel) colour‚Äìkinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn‚Äôt possible at the loop‚Äêlevel. For example, we give a concise proof that the BLG and ABJM M2‚Äêbrane models have tree‚Äêlevel colour‚Äìkinematics duality.

SUMMARY:Guilherme Almeida (SISSA, Trieste), An overview of Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds
DESCRIPTION:Dubrovin Frobenius manifold is a geometric interpretation of a remarkable system of differential equations, called WDVV equations. Since the beginning of the nineties, there has been a continuous exchange of ideas from fields that are not trivially related to each other, such as: Topological quantum field theory, non‚Äêlinear waves, singularity theory, random matrices theory, integrable hierarchies of KdV type, and Painlev√© equations. Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds theory is the bridge between them. In the first part of the talk, I will review the notion of Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds and its relationship with finite reflection groups and its extensions, isomonodromic deformation equations and Integrable hierarchy of KdV type. In the second part of the seminar, I will review the differential geometry of Orbit spaces of reflection groups and its extensions, which are one of the main examples of Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds. Thereafter, I will present a new extension of finite reflection group, which its orbit space has a Dubrovin Frobenius structure. This work is based on the papers arXiv:1907.01436 and arXiv:2004.01780.

SUMMARY:Luigi Alfonsi (Queen Mary University of London), Towards an extended/higher correspondence ‚Äì generalised geometry, bundle gerbes and global ùëá‚Äêduality
DESCRIPTION:Extended Geometry is the geometric framework which makes ùëá‚Äêduality and ùëà‚Äêduality manifest symmetries. This is realised by lifting generalised geometry to a higher dimensional space which is, at least locally, the space underlying the fundamental representation of the duality group. However, despite its relevance in M‚Äêtheory, the global aspects of Extended Geometry are still unclear. I propose a global formulation of Extended Geometry via a generalisation of Kaluza‚ÄìKlein principle which unifies a metric and a higher gauge field on a categorified principal bundle (e.g. a bundle gerbe). I will illustrate the relation of this formulation with usual generalised geometry and with the string ùúé‚Äêmodel. Finally, I will discuss how a global notion of generalised fluxes (geometric and non‚Äêgeometric) emerges from this picture and how this is related to a higher gauge theory with the string 2‚Äêgroup.

SUMMARY:Severin Bunk (University of Oxford), Symmetries of gerbes, anomalies, and topology
DESCRIPTION:Gerbes are geometric objects which describe the third integer cohomology of a manifold and the ùêµ‚Äêfield in string theory. Infinitesimal symmetries of gerbes on a manifold ùëÄ are associated with algebroids on ùëÄ. In this talk, we instead investigate finite symmetries of gerbes; we demonstrate how in the presence of a Lie group action on ùëÄ, a gerbe on ùëÄ induces an extension of the acting Lie group by a 2‚Äêgroup. These extensions have various applications: they contain all information about equivariant structures on gerbes, explain non-associative magnetic translations, describe anomalies in QFTs in odd dimensions, and give rise to new models for the string group.

SUMMARY:Congkao Wen Ê∏©‰ªéÁÉ§ (Queen Mary University of London), Integrated correlators in ùí©=4 super Yang‚ÄìMills
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, I will present an exact expression for an integrated correlator of four BPS operators in ùí©=4 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills (SYM) with any classical gauge group ùê∫ùëÅ. I will show that this can be expressed as a simple two-dimensional lattice sum, which is a function of ùëÅ and of the complex Yang‚ÄìMills coupling ùúè=ùúÉ/2œÄ+i4œÄ/ùëîYM2. This expression contains infinite orders of perturbative and non-perturbative instanton terms, and manifests the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive duality of ùí©=4 SYM. Furthermore, the integrated correlator satisfies a striking ‚ÄòLaplace difference‚Äô equation, which determines the integrated correlator for all classical gauge groups in terms of the SU(2) correlator. I will also comment on matching our result with the standard Feynman diagram computation, and the relation to four-graviton amplitude in type ‚Ö°B superstring in AdS space.

DESCRIPTION:I will introduce a simple formula for the action of supersymmetric solutions to minimal gauged supergravity in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Such solutions are equipped with a Killing vector, and I will show that the holographically renormalized action may be expressed entirely in terms of the weights of this vector field at its fixed points, together with certain topological data. In this sense, the classical gravitational partition function localizes in the bulk, and depends only on the topology of the fixed point set.

SUMMARY:Atul Sharma (University of Oxford), Twistors, gravity and celestial holography

Semiclassical correlators of the model take us beyond self-dual GR and give rise to Hodges‚Äô formula for tree-level MHV graviton amplitudes. Whereas its 2d OPE algebra reproduces the infinite-dimensional ùë§1+‚àû algebra recently discovered by Strominger to be the symmetry algebra of celestial holography.This talk is based on the works arXiv:2103.16984 and arXiv:2110.06066.

SUMMARY:Alexander Schenkel (University of Nottingham), BV and BFV formalism beyond perturbation theory
DESCRIPTION:Modern approaches to quantum field theory, such as factorization algebras and homotopical AQFT, are based on cohomological methods in field theory that have been developed over the past decades in the context of the BV and BFV formalisms. While these techniques work pretty well for perturbative quantum field theories, they have intrinsic limitations to describe global features, such as the topology of the gauge group or moduli of bundles. Derived algebraic geometry is a powerful geometric framework in which one can attempt to globalize the BV and BFV formalisms. I will start this talk with a very basic introduction to derived algebraic geometry, focussing in particular on its more concrete and computational aspects. I will then illustrate the power and potential of this framework for new developments in mathematical physics by studying two applications:The non-perturbative BV formalism for a function ùëì:[ùëã‚àïùê∫]‚Üíùëò on a quotient stack, andthe quantization of a derived cotangent stack T‚àó[ùëã‚àïùê∫] over a quotient stack, which is a global version of BFV quantization.This talk is based on joint works with Benini and Safronov [2104.14886] and Benini and Pridham [2201.10225].

I will then define a holomorphic model which wepropose describes the minimal twist of the six‚Äêdimensional superconformal theory associated to the Lie algebra ùî∞ùî©(2). A primary source of evidence forthis proposal is via an approach to holography in the twisted setting using Koszul duality.

In this talk I will introduce the category of Lie groupoids and bibundles between them, in order to provide the definition of a smooth 2‚Äêgroup. I will define principal bundles for such a smooth 2‚Äêgroup and provide classification results that allow us to compare them to principal bundles for ordinary groups. I will conclude with some potential applications of these ideas to various areas, including string geometry, Chern‚ÄìSimons theory, and equivariant elliptic cohomology. This talk is based on joint work with Dan Berwick‚ÄêEvans, Laura Murray, Apurva Nakade, and Emma Phillips. I will not assume any previous background on 2‚Äêgroups or Lie groupoids.

SUMMARY:Martin Cederwall (Chalmers University of Technology), Supersymmetry and Koszul duality
DESCRIPTION:The pure spinor superfield formalism is a very general method to construct supermultiplets, and in certain cases, Batalin‚ÄîVilkovisky actions for them, using extra variables inthe form of constrained spinors. The main focus has typically been on thecircumvention of old ‚Äúno‚Äêgo theorems‚Äù against manifestly supersymmetric off-shell formulation of maximally supersymmetric models, such as ùê∑=10 super-Yang‚ÄîMills theory and ùê∑=11 supergravity.

This is work in collaboration with S. Jonsson, J. Palmkvist and I. Saberi.

This construction provides a simultaneous generalisation ofHecke algebras of finite groups and of skew group algebras.

I will also discuss the representationtheory of these algebras and their homological properties such as global dimension. If there is time I will explainthe relevance of these algebras to the study of quantum reference frames, andpossible analogues of skew Hecke algebras for von Neumann algebras. This is based on work inprogress, joint with Leon Loveridge (University of South‚ÄêEastern Norway) and Jan G≈Çowacki (PAN Centre for Theoretical Physics, Warsaw).

SUMMARY:Lewis Napper (University of Surrey), Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re Geometry and the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations
DESCRIPTION:Partial differential equations of Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re type have been shown to correspond to specific choices of differential form on the associated phase space. Furthermore, Lagrangian submanifolds of said space may be viewed as a generalisation of solutions to a Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation. Building from the observation that the Poisson equation for the pressureof an incompressible, two-dimensional, Navier‚ÄìStokes flow can be presented as an equationof Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re type, this talk introduces a framework for studying fluid dynamics using properties of the aforementioned submanifolds. In particular, it is noted that such a submanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for the dominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluid flows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use of higher (categorified) symplectic geometry. We conclude with some comments on how this facilitates symmetry reductions and some open questions.
