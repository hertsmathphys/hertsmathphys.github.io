This allows for a uniform description of the eleven-dimensional theory and its twists in terms of homotopy Poisson-Chern-Simons theory on appropriate superspaces. If time permits, I will further discuss higher symmetries in twisted supergravity theories and how they hint towards interesting global structures.</></abstract></details>

We demonstrate a hidden simplicity in the structure of in-in correlators arising by adding various building blocks, which allows us to obtain a new integral representation for the in-in correlators in terms of scattering amplitudes in flat space. Therefore, enabling us to study cosmological graphs by exploiting amplitude tools and derive new relations for in-in correlators. Since dS wave functions are equivalent to AdS correlators by analytic continuation, a part of the analysis is also valid for AdS correlators. <a href='2025-09-24-Chowdhury.pdf'>(slides)</a></></abstract></details>

This is a fascinating correspondence between geometry and conformal field theory that has spectacular consequences: for instance, mirror symmetry was originally discovered this way! Although the correspondence is well understood for torsion-free G-structures and compactifications without fluxes, very little is known for more general G-structures in the presence of NS flux. In this talk I will present the first steps to identify these conformal algebras. We will do so through a study of the classical sigma model, focusing on the case of G2 manifolds. Time permitting, I will discuss how to reformulate these results in the language of Vertex Operator Algebras and present some explicit examples.</>
<p>This talk is based on 2412.13904, joint with Xenia de la Ossa and Enrico Marchetto, and on 2502.02769, joint with Andoni de Arriba de la Hera and Mario Garcia-Fernandez. It also connects with some ongoing work with Leron Borsten and Hyungrok Kim. <a href='2025-10-01-Galdeano.pdf'>(slides)</a></></abstract></details>

I will diagnose this mixing and compute it coefficient using the conformal block expansion of 4-point Witten diagrams involving extremal couplings. I will then study the simplest dual pair in which such couplings arise: 4d N=2 theories dual to AdS5 x S5 with some 7-branes. Summing a tower of extremal Witten diagrams provides the final piece of the gluon 4-point function to order 1/N^2.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-10-15 15:00:00'>15 October, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Falk Hassler (University of Wrocław): Strings, Membranes, and a Hidden Symmetry Algebra in Quantum Gravity</contents></summary><abstract><p>Geometry underpins gravity, while the quantum world is governed by algebras of observables. In string theory, (super)gravity and its quantum corrections emerge from specific vibration modes of relativistic strings, described by vertex operator algebras in two-dimensional conformal field theories. However, the precise map between these two is highly non-trivial and is only known explicitly to the first orders in a perturbative expansion. I will reveal a new, infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra that at least reproduces the leading two orders of quantum corrections. Remarkably, it has the potential to evade a no-go theorem that rules out competing approaches to uncover hidden symmetries in supergravity beyond second-order corrections. Given that many of the algebraic structures encountered here have a natural generalization from strings to membranes, this suggests a similar approach to analyzing quantum corrections in 11-dimensional supergravity - the low-energy limit of M-theory. Beyond fundamental insights, these results have broad applications, including the construction of new supergravity solutions, the analysis of their spectrum, the computation of renormalization group flows in two-dimensional σ-models, and the study of integrable strings. A generalization of Cartan geometry is found on the mathematical side.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-10-22 15:00:00'>22 October, 15:00</time> - C408</coordinates><contents>Chris Hull (Imperial College London): A New Superstring Field Theory Action</contents></summary><abstract><p>Sen’s superstring field theory successfully formulates perturbative superstring theory but has a number of strange features.</>
<p></>
<p>The action is not fully background independent and it does not have standard diffeomorphism symmetry - instead there is an exotic gauge symmetry that acts on some fields but not others.</>
<p></>
<p>These issues greatly restrict the spacetimes that this action can be applied to.</>
<p></>
<p>A new action is found that reduces to Sen’s in a certain limit but which has diffeomorphism symmetry together with further exotic symmetries and is background independent. As a result, it can be applied to any spacetime.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-10-29 15:00:00'>29 October, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Neil Lambert (King's College London): Quantum and Classical Properties of the Sen Acton for Self-Dual Fields</contents></summary><abstract><p>Sen has proposed a novel action for self-dual fields that has been generalised by Hull to include two metrics. The resulting theory has many novel features including two independent diffeomorphism-like symmetries. Furthermore the action is quadratic in the fields and as a result the path-integral can be can be computed. We will discuss various aspect of this theory in two-dimensions such as the partition function and  modular invariance.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-11-05 15:00:00'>5 November, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Ines Aniceto (University of Southampton): Analytic approaches to the relativistic Boltzmann equation</contents></summary><abstract><p>The emergence of a universal pre-hydrodynamic attractor behaviour during fluid thermalisation is an important feature in the study of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions and cold atom experiments: highly non-hydrodynamic behaviour dictated by initial conditions quickly decays towards this attractor solution, with the resulting hydrodynamic system independent of the initial state.</>
<p></>
<p>There are many approaches to study the emergence of this attractor. We will briefly review these approaches, then focusing on kinetic theory. Starting with the relativist Boltzmann equation in the so-called relaxation time approximation, we introduce a series of moments and their generating function, which we show solved a single PDE. We solve this PDE perturbatively for all moments, both in the small and large time approximations, and we then recover the free streaming and attractor regimes at each end via methods of analytic continuation.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-11-12 15:00:00'>12 November, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Guillermo Arias-Tamargo (Imperial College London): Non-invertible symmetries in non-linear sigma models</contents></summary><abstract><p>Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this talk I will discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. I will also present several applications of this symmetry, which include the protection of some coupling constants of the sigma model from quantum corrections as well as new Ward identities. Time permitting, I'll discuss the target space interpretation of these defects, and their fate in String Theory.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-11-19 15:00:00'>19 November, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Chettha Saelim (University of Surrey): Extremal Black Holes from Homotopy Algebras</contents></summary><abstract><p>While strong uniqueness theorems hold for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in four dimensions, the results break down in higher dimensions and when the asymptotically flat condition is relaxed. Nonetheless, there has been significant progress in classifying the near-horizon geometries of extremal black holes. Motivated by this, we start with near-horizon geometries, which are better understood, and deform them to obtain extremal black hole solutions.  We investigate whether a given near-horizon geometry uniquely corresponds to a black hole solution or if there are multiple black holes with the same near-horizon geometry. Our approach employs the homotopy algebraic framework, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Using homological perturbation theory, we recursively solve the deformation problem order by order. To illustrate the method, we present a concrete example of the deformation of the extremal Kerr horizon.</></abstract></details>

In many cases, it is possible to find all such theories.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-12-03 15:00:00'>3 December, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Chris White (Queen Mary University of London): The magic of scattering amplitudes</contents></summary><abstract><p>In recent years, a growing community of researchers have been applying ideas from Quantum Information / Computing theory to high energy physics. Entanglement is one such quantity, but there are by now many others. This talk will examine the property of “magic” (also known as “non-stabliserness”) which, roughly speaking, measures whether quantum systems have a genuine computational advantage over their classical counterparts. I will review the origin of this concept, before describing recent applications from both collider physics and scattering amplitudes research. No prior knowledge of quantum computing will be assumed.</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2025-12-10 15:00:00'>10 December, 15:00</time> - B404</coordinates><contents>Jakub Opršal (University of Birmingham): A topological proof of the <math><mi>H</mi></math>-colouring dichotomy</contents></summary><abstract><p>A colouring of a graph with <math><mi>k</mi></math> colours is an assignment of colours to vertices so that no edge is monochromatic. As it is well-known colouring with 2 colours is in P while colouring with <math><mi>k &gt; 2</mi></math> colours is NP-complete. This dichotomy was extended to the <it>graph homomorphism problem</it>, also called <math><mi>H</mi></math>-colouring, by Hell and Nešetřil [J. Comb. Theory B, 48(1):92-110, 1990]. More precisely, they proved that deciding whether there is a graph homomorphism from a given graph to a fixed graph <math><mi>H</mi></math> is in P if <math><mi>H</mi></math> is bipartite (or contains a self-loop), and is NP-complete otherwise. This dichotomy served as an important test-case for the Feder–Vardi dichotomy conjecture, and Bulatov–Zhuk dichotomy of complexity of finite-template CSPs.</>
<p></>
<p>In the talk, I will present a new proof of this theorem using tools from topological combinatorics based on ideas of Lovász [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 25(3):319-324, 1978] and Brower’s fixed-point theorem. This is joint work with Sebastian Meyer (TU Dresden).</></abstract></details>
<details><summary><coordinates><time datetime='2026-01-09 15:00:00'>9 January, 15:00</time> - E350</coordinates><contents>Yann Peresse (University of Hertfordshire): Semigroups Of Generalised Symmetries</contents></summary><abstract><p>Symmetry is a recurring concept in both Science and Art. Upon hearing the term, one initially tends to think of rotations and reflections found in Geometry. However, if we recall that, formally, the symmetries of a geometric shape <math><mi>X</mi></math> are just the distance preserving bijections <math><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi> <mo>&rarr;</mo> <mi>X</mi></math>, then we see that this idea naturally generalises from Geometry to virtually all areas of Mathematics: The symmetries of any kind of mathematical object <math><mi>X</mi></math> are the bijections <math><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi> <mo>&rarr;</mo> <mi>X</mi></math> which preserve the structure of <math><mi>X</mi></math>.</>
<p></>
<p>For example, the symmetries of a graph, group, or vector space are its automorphisms and the symmetries of a topological space its homeomorphisms. In each case, the symmetries of <math><mi>X</mi></math> form a subgroup of the symmetric group <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math> of all permutations of <math><mi>X</mi></math>. By Cayley's Theorem, all groups are isomorphic to subgroups of symmetric groups, and so Group Theory is essentially the study of symmetries.</>
<p></>
<p>There are two widely-studied and natural generalisations of the concept of symmetry above which correspond to generalisations of groups to semigroups and inverse semigroups, respectively. First, one might drop the requirement that symmetries need to be invertible. For example, one might consider all continuous transformations of some topological space <math><mi>X</mi></math>. This takes us from subgroups of <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math> to subsemigroups of the <i>Full Transformation Monoid</i> <math><mi>X</mi><mo><sup></mo><mi>X</mi></sup></math> of all functions from <math><mi>X</mi></math> to <math><mi>X</mi></math>.</>
<p></>
<p>Alternatively, one might be interested not just in the symmetries of the whole structure <math><mi>X</mi></math>, but also in partial symmetries, i.e. symmetries between substructures of <math><mi>X</mi></math>. This approach takes us to studying inverse subsemigroups of the <i>Symmetric Inverse Monoid</i> <math><mi>I</mi><sub><mi>X</mi></sub></math> consisting of all bijections between subsets of <math><mi>X</mi></math>.</>
<p></>
<p>In this talk, we will consider <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math>, <math><mi>X</mi><mo><sup></mo><mi>X</mi></sup></math>, and <math><mi>I</mi><sub><mi>X</mi></sub></math> on an infinite set <math><mi>X</mi></math>. I will present a variety of results which highlight the connections between semigroups (including groups and inverse semigroups) on the one hand and Set Theory, Model Theory, and Topology on the other. No previous knowledge of Semigroup Theory will be assumed.</></abstract></details>

For instance, <math><mi>B</mi></math> can be the classifying space of a finite group or a finite 2-group.</>
<p>In this talk, I will report on recent joint work with Tim Porter on  once-extended versions of Kontsevich-Quinn TQFT, taking values in the symmetric monoidal bicategory of groupoids, linear profunctors, and natural transformations between linear profunctors. The construction works in all dimensions, yielding (0,1,2)-, (1,2,3)-, and (2,3,4)-extended TQFTs, given a homotopy finite space <math><mi>B</mi></math>. I will show how to compute these once-extended TQFTs when <math><mi>B</mi></math> is the classifying space of a homotopy 2-type, represented by a crossed module of groups. Time permitting, I will address the twice-extended TQFTs also arising, as well as the ensuing representations of motion groups.</>

I will discuss some recent work that shows how these structures and their deformations govern supersymmetric and superconformal field theories in geometric fashion. A superconformal structure equips a supermanifold with a sheaf of dg commutative algebras; the tangent sheaf of this dg ringed space reproduces the Weyl multiplet of conformal supergravity (equivalently, the superconformal stress tensor multiplet), in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry. This construction is uniform under twists, and thus provides a classification of relations between superconformal theories, chiral algebras, higher Virasoro algebras, and more exotic examples.</></abstract></details>

Their distinguishing property is that (Wilson) loop operators carry charge under this global symmetry. As ordinary (<math><mn>0</mn></math>‐form) symmetries, they can be spontaneously broken or restored. Importantly such symmetries allow a rigorous definition of the confining phase, as the phase where the symmetry is restored, and Wilson loops obey area law. The alternative is that the symmetry is spontaneously broken, and Wilson loops get an expectation value, proportional to their length (the perimeter law). In 4d, the symmetry is discrete (e.g. <math><msub><mo>ℤ</mo><mi>𝑁</mi></msub></math>) the spontaneously broken phase is a <abbr title='topological quantum field theory'>TQFT</abbr>, while if it is continuous (e.g. <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>U</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>) is a photon phase, where photons are viewed as Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken symmetry group. Surprisingly, however, even systems with only a discrete <math><mn>1</mn></math>‐form symmetry generically have a photon phase. Moreover this photon phase can be seen as proliferation of string‐like objects — popularily called center vortices in <abbr title='quantum chromodynamics'>QCD</abbr> literature — which are commonly claimed to cause confinement. Rather I will argue theoretically, and demonstrate numerically that such objects cause the emergence of a <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>U</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math> theory, while another type of particle like object — the monopole — may cause confinement. I will give explicit examples in <math><msub><mo>ℤ</mo><mi>𝑁</mi></msub></math> lattice gauge theory of such phenomena.</></abstract></details>

Twisted Yangians are a family of algebras of a totally different pedigree.

A famous theorem of Brundan and Kleshchev states that the finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras of type A arise as quotients of the (shifted) Yangian associated to general linear algebras. For finite W-algebras associated to even nilpotent elements in types B, C, D it turns out that the (shifted) twisted Yangians are the correct replacement.

Despite the lack of rigorous foundations to support many advancements made by physicists, mathematicians have engaged in a fruitful endeavor to formalize QFTs. In current times, we find ourselves at a crossroads: while we still lack the comprehensive techniques and language to fully grasp QFT, numerous distinct axiomatic frameworks are attempting to capture its essence. A natural question arises: how are these approaches connected? This talk will focus on two such frameworks: Algebraic Quantum Field Theories (AQFTs) and Factorization Algebras (FAs). The significance of these frameworks is motivated, among other things, by rigorous programs led by Fredenhagen–Rejzner and Costello–Gwilliam to construct perturbative QFTs using AQFTs and FAs, respectively. Recent contributions from Gwilliam–Rejzner and Benini–Musante–Schenkel establish a relationship between these two programs, vaguely speaking. At a more structural level, Benini–Perin–Schenkel have established an equivalence of 1-categories between specific subcategories of AQFTs and (time‐orderable pre‐)FAs. The goal of this talk is to present our proof of an even broader equivalence between <math><mo>∞</mo></math>‐categories of AQFTs and tpFAs.<p>This talk is based on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318'>arXiv:2412.07318</a> and ongoing joint work with M.

After half a decade, this duality was seen to be present in classical physics for exact solutions in classical Yang–Mills theory and general relativity. Arising from the Double Copy, the phenomenon of <abbr title='Bern–Carrasco–Johansson'>BCJ</abbr> duality implies that gauge theories are more complex than previously thought. They are now known to possess an abstract kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non‐abelian gauge theories, such that one typically works outwards from well‐known examples. In this talk, we explore using simpler abelian gauge theories to clarify our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well‐defined subalgebras of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subalgebras, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory.

Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form.</></abstract></details>

We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups.

They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang–Mills squared</mtext></math>!</li> <li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol><p>We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry.

This result inspired a series of investigations of the word problem in other one‐relator algebraic structures. For example, in the 1960s Shirshov proved the word problem is decidable in one‐relator Lie algebras. In contrast, it remains a longstanding open problem whether the word problem is decidable for one‐relator monoids. An important class of algebraic structures lying in between monoids and groups is that of inverse monoids. In this talk I will speak about a recent result which shows that there exist one‐relator inverse monoids of the form <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>Inv</mi><mo>⟨</mo><mi>𝐴</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>𝑤</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>⟩</mo></math> with undecidable word problem.
