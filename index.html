Since the beginning of the nineties, there has been a continuous exchange of ideas from fields that are not trivially related to each other, such as: Topological quantum field theory, non‐linear waves, singularity theory, random matrices theory, integrable hierarchies of KdV type, and Painlevé equations. Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds theory is the bridge between them. <p>In the first part of the talk, I will review the notion of Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds and its relationship with finite reflection groups and its extensions, isomonodromic deformation equations and Integrable hierarchy of KdV type. In the second part of the seminar, I will review the differential geometry of Orbit spaces of reflection groups and its extensions, which are one of the main examples of Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds. Thereafter, I will present a new extension of finite reflection group, which its orbit space has a Dubrovin Frobenius structure. This work is based on the papers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01436.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01780.pdf.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2021-05-12'>2021-05-12</time>: Luigi Alfonsi (Queen Mary University of London), Towards an extended/higher correspondence – generalised geometry, bundle gerbes and global T-duality</summary>Extended Geometry is the geometric framework which makes <math><mi>𝑇</mi></math>‐duality and <math><mi>𝑈</mi></math>‐duality manifest symmetries. This is realised by lifting generalised geometry to a higher dimensional space which is, at least locally, the space underlying the fundamental representation of the duality group. However, despite its relevance in M‐theory, the global aspects of Extended Geometry are still unclear. <p>I propose a global formulation of Extended Geometry via a generalisation of Kaluza–Klein principle which unifies a metric and a higher gauge field on a categorified principal bundle (e.g. a bundle gerbe). I will illustrate the relation of this formulation with usual generalised geometry and with the string <math><mi>𝜎</mi></math>‐model. Finally, I will discuss how a global notion of generalised fluxes (geometric and non‐geometric) emerges from this picture and how this is related to a higher gauge theory with the string 2‐group.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2021-12-07'>2021-12-07</time>: Severin Bunk (University of Oxford), Symmetries of gerbes, anomalies, and topology</summary>Gerbes are geometric objects which describe the third integer cohomology of a manifold and the <math><mi>𝐵</mi></math>‐field in string theory. Infinitesimal symmetries of gerbes on a manifold <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math> are associated with algebroids on <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math>. In this talk, we instead investigate finite symmetries of gerbes; we demonstrate how in the presence of a Lie group action on <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math>, a gerbe on <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math> induces an extension of the acting Lie group by a 2‐group. These extensions have various applications: they contain all information about equivariant structures on gerbes, explain non-associative magnetic translations, describe anomalies in <abbr title='quantum field theories'>QFTs</abbr> in odd dimensions, and give rise to new models for the string group.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-03-09'>2022-03-09</time>: Congkao Wen (Queen Mary University of London), Integrated correlators in <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></math> super Yang-Mills</summary>In this talk, I will present an exact expression for an integrated correlator of four BPS operators in <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></math> supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) with any classical gauge group G_N. I will show that this can be expressed as a simple two-dimensional lattice sum, which is a function of N and of the complex Yang-Mills coupling <math><mi>𝜏</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>𝜃</mi><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>i</mi><mn>4</mn><mi>π</mi><mo>/</mo><msubsup><mi>𝑔</mi><mtext>YM</mtext><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math>. This expression contains infinite orders of perturbative and non-perturbative instanton terms, and manifests the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive duality of <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></math> SYM. Furthermore, the integrated correlator satisfies a striking ‘Laplace difference’ equation, which determines the integrated correlator for all classical gauge groups in terms of the <math><mi>SU</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></math> correlator. I will also comment on matching our result with the standard Feynman diagram computation, and the relation to four-graviton amplitude in type ⅡB superstring in AdS space. </details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-03-24'>2022-03-24</time>: Pietro Benetti Genolini (King’s College London), Localization of the action in AdS/CFT</summary>I will introduce a simple formula for the action of supersymmetric solutions to minimal gauged supergravity in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Such solutions are equipped with a Killing vector, and I will show that the holographically renormalized action may be expressed entirely in terms of the weights of this vector field at its fixed points, together with certain topological data. In this sense, the classical gravitational partition function localizes in the bulk, and depends only on the topology of the fixed point set.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-04-06'>2022-04-06</time>: Atul Sharma (University of Oxford), Twistors, gravity and celestial holography</summary>I will describe a 2-dimensional sigmamodel that is dual to self-dual GR in 4-dimensional flat space. Our sigma modelgoverns holomorphic maps from the Riemann sphere to twistor space. Semiclassical correlators of the model take us beyond self-dual GR and giverise to Hodges' formula for tree-level MHV graviton amplitudes. Whereas its 2dOPE algebra reproduces the infinite-dimensional w_{1+infinity} algebra recentlydiscovered by Strominger to be the symmetry algebra of celestial holography.This talk is based on the works https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16984 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06066.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-04-20'>2022-04-20</time>: Alexander Schenkel (University of Nottingham), BV and BFV formalism beyond perturbation theory</summary>Modern approaches to quantum field theory, such as factorization algebras and homotopical AQFT, are based on cohomological methods in field theory that have been developed over the past decades in the context of the BV and BFV formalisms. While these techniques work pretty well for perturbative quantum field theories, they have intrinsic limitations to describe global features, such as the topology of the gauge group or moduli of bundles.Derived algebraic geometry is a powerful geometric framework in which one can attempt to globalize the BV and BFV formalisms. I will start this talk with a very basic introduction to derived algebraic geometry, focussing in particular on its more concrete and computational aspects. I will then illustrate the power and potential of this framework for new developments in mathematical physics by studying two applications: 1.) The non-perturbative BV formalism for a function <math><mi>𝑓</mi><mo>:</mo><mo>[</mo><mi>𝑋</mi><mo>∕</mo><mi>𝐺</mi><mo>]</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>𝑘</mi></math> on a quotient stack, and 2.) the quantization of a derived cotangent stack T*[X/G] over a quotient stack, which is a global version of BFV quantization. This talk is based on joint works with Benini and Safronov [2104.14886] and Benini and Pridham [2201.10225].</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-05-25'>2022-05-25</time>: Brian R. Williams (University of Edinburgh), A holomorphic approach to fivebranes</summary>In almost all situations, the twist of a supersymmetric <abbr title='quantum field theory'>QFT</abbr> has the structure of a holomorphic <abbr title='quantum field theory'>QFT</abbr>. I’ll review general aspects of holomorphic <abbr title='quantum field theory'>QFT</abbr> while drawing parallels to the familiarsituation of chiral <abbr title='conformal field theory'>CFT</abbr>. I will then define a holomorphic model which wepropose describes the minimal twist of the six‐dimensional superconformal theory associated to the Lie algebra <math><mi>𝔰𝔩</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></math>. A primary source of evidence forthis proposal is via an approach to holography in the twisted setting using Koszul duality.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-06-01'>2022-06-01</time>: Kasia Rejzner (University of York), Symmetries in mathematical perturbative quantum field theory</summary>In this talk I will give an overview of (perturbative) algebraic quantum field theory and explain how it can be applied to describe interacting QFT models. I will then report on new progress in the description of renormalization group and symmetries, using nets of C*-algebras.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-09-07'>2022-09-07</time>: <span lang='de'>Christian Sämann</span> (Heriot-Watt University), T-duality with categorified principal bundles</summary>The data appearing in the Buscher rules forT-duality, the Kalb-Ramond field and the metric, can be unified to a connection on a categorified principal bundle governing all geometric T-dualities. Interestingly, this picture allows for a direct extension to T-dualities involving non-geometric backgrounds. Before explaining all this, I will give a gentle introduction to categorified principal bundles.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-11-16'>2022-11-16</time>: Emily Cliff (Université de Sherbrooke), Higher symmetries: smooth 2‐groups and their principal bundles</summary>A 2‐group is acategorical generalization of a group: it’s a category with a multiplication operation which satisfies the usual group axioms only up to coherentisomorphisms. In this talk I will introduce the category of Lie groupoids and bibundles between them, in order to provide the definition of a smooth 2-group. I will define principal bundles for such a smooth 2‐group and provide classification results that allow us to compare them to principal bundles for ordinary groups. I will conclude with some potential applications of these ideas to various areas, including string geometry, Chern–Simons theory, and equivariant elliptic cohomology. This talk is based on joint work with Dan Berwick‐Evans, Laura Murray, Apurva Nakade, and Emma Phillips. I will not assume any previous background on 2‐groups or Lie groupoids.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-11-24'>2022-11-24</time>: <span lang='sv'>Martin Cederwall</span> (Chalmers University of Technology), Supersymmetry and Koszul duality</summary>The pure spinor superfield formalism is a very general method to construct supermultiplets, and in certain cases, Batalin—Vilkovisky actions for them, using extra variables inthe form of constrained spinors. The main focus has typically been on thecircumvention of old “no‐go theorems” against manifestly supersymmetric off-shell formulation of maximally supersymmetric models, such as <math><mi>𝐷</math><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></math> super-Yang—Mills theory and <math><mi>𝐷</math><mo>=</mo><mn>11</mn></math> supergravity. In this talk, I will briefly review the formalism, and then describe how the constrained spinors are Koszuldual to certain superalgebras, generically <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math> algebras, constructed fromthe supermultiplets, and how these algebras introduce non‐linear structures on the supermultiplets. This is work in collaboration with S. Jonsson, J. Palmkvist and I. Saberi.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2022-11-30'>2022-11-30</time>: <span lang='sk'>Fridrich Valach</span> (Imperial College London), G-algebroids, embeddingtensors, and Poisson–Lie duality</summary>I will describe a class ofstructures, known as G-algebroids, which arises as a natural generalisation ofthe ordinary, generalised, and exceptional tangent bundles from ordinary,generalised, and exceptional geometry, respectively. I will discuss aclassification result in the exceptional case and show how to obtain thepossible fluxes/twists of the bracket. In the M-theory and IIB setups, thetwists organise themselves naturally into connections and covariantly constantdifferential forms, while in the IIA case one in particular recovers both theRomans mass and the deformation of Howe–Lambert–West. Finally, I will show howto use these algebroids to answer a question about the realisability ofembedding tensors (providing a new perspective on the result of Inverso '17) and to give a joint description of the Poisson–Lie T- and U-duality. This is ajoint work with M. Bugden, O. Hulik, and D. Waldram.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-02-22'>2023-02-22</time>: Cheuk Yu Mak (University of Southampton), Quantum cohomology and loop group action</summary>Quantum cohomology isan invariant of symplectic manifolds. It is a commutative deformation of theusual cohomology as an algebra, where the deformation is controlled by countingcertain holomorphic spheres. In this talk, we will first explain how it isrelated to the loop space, and to Floer cohomology. Then we will sketch that,in the presence of a Hamiltonian G-action on a symplectic manifold M with acompact Lie group G,  how we can obtain an action on the G-equivariantquantum cohomology from the G-equivariant Borel-Moore homology of the basedloop space of G. No knowledge on symplectic geometry is assumed. This is ajoint work with Eduardo González and Dan Pomerleano.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-03-22'>2023-03-22</time>: Arthur Lipstein (Durham University), From amplitudes to cosmology</summary>Whereas scattering amplitudes probe physics atthe shortest distances, cosmology probes physics at the largest scales. Nevertheless, many concepts discovered in the study of scattering amplitudes generalise to cosmological observables. In this talk I will describe some aspects of this program which I have recently been investigating such as thedouble copy, scattering equations, and soft limits, and will discuss how these directions are interrelated.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-03-29'>2023-03-29</time>: James Waldron (University of Newcastle), Skew Hecke Algebras</summary>Given a finite group <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>, a subgroup <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math>, and an action of <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math> on an algebra <math><mi>𝐴</mi></math>, we define an associated ‘skew Hecke algebra’. This construction provides a simultaneous generalisation ofHecke algebras of finite groups and of skew group algebras. I will explain someof the basic properties of these algebras, some results about their structure, and the relation to rings of invariants. I will also discuss the representationtheory of these algebras and their homological properties such as globaldimension. If there is time I will explainthe relevance of these algebras to the study of quantum reference frames, andpossible analogues of skew Hecke algebras for von Neumann algebras. This is based on work inprogress, joint with Leon Loveridge (University of South-Eastern Norway) and Jan Glowacki (PAN Centre for Theoretical Physics, Warsaw).</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-04-26'>2023-04-26</time>: Lewis Napper (University of Surrey), Monge–Ampère Geometry and the Navier–Stokes equations</summary>Partial differential equations of Monge–Ampère type have been shown to correspond tospecific choices of differential form on the associated phase space. Furthermore, Lagrangian submanifolds of said space may be viewed as a generalisation of solutions to a Monge–Ampère equation. Building from the observation that the Poisson equation for the pressureof an incompressible, two-dimensional, Navier–Stokes flow can be presented as an equationof Monge–Ampère type, this talk introduces a framework for studying fluid dynamics using properties of the aforementioned submanifolds. In particular, it is noted that such asubmanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for thedominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluidflows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use ofhigher (categorified) symplectic geometry. We conclude with some comments on how thisfacilitates symmetry reductions and some open questions.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-11-15'>2023-11-15</time>: <span lang='de'>Julian Mateo Kupka</span> (University of Hertfordshire), Non‐relativistic geometry and why you might care</summary>This talk explores non‐relativistic geometry, a mathematical framework allowing us to formulate Newtonian physics analogously to General Relativity, <abbr title='id est'>i.e.</abbr> geometrizing it. We will build the geometry and theory from the ground up and explain how exactly it encodes Newtonian gravity in a diffeomorphism invariant fashion. We will then connect it to null reductions, which allows us to relate non‐relativistic to relativistic physics with a special null direction, highlighting why you might encounter it in your applications.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-11-22'>2023-11-22</time>: Leron Borsten (University of Hertfordshire), Higher symmetries and homotopy algebras: scattering amplitudes, colour–kinematics duality, <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐ and <math><msubsup><mi>BV</mi><mo>∞</mo><mo>◽️</mo></msubsup></math>‐algebras, the double copy and M2‐branes models</summary>The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:<ol><li>Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang–Mills squared</mtext></math>!</li>
<li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol>
We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>◽️</mo></msup></math>‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-11-29'>2023-11-29</time>: <span lang='es'>Javier José Murgas Ibarra</span> (<span lang='no'>Universitetet i Stavanger</span>), A heterotic Kodaira–Spencer theory</summary>Taking extrema of the six‐dimensional heterotic superpotential gives the so‐called <math><mi>𝐹</mi></math>‐term constraints of the Hull–Strominger system. Starting at a solution, one can consider ‘off‐shell’ fluctuations of the structure in the superpotential. This gives rise to a theory with similar features to Kodaira–Spencer gravity. A natural next step is then to quantise this theory. I will discuss the computation of the one‐loop partition function and find it can be expressed as a product of holomorphic Ray–Singer torsions. Finally, I will discuss its potential metric anomaly.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-12-06'>2023-12-06</time>: Benjamin Hoare (Durham University), Diamonds of integrable deformations</summary>There are two well‐known origins of 2‐dimensional integrable <abbr title='quantum field theories'>QFTs</abbr> from 4 dimensions — localisation of 4d Chern–Simons and symmetry reduction of 4d anti‐self‐dual Yang–Mills. It is a conjecture of Costello that these can be unified in a diamond of theories, starting from holomorphic Chern–Simons theory in 6 dimensions.
It has been shown how this works for the simplest class of theories, including the principal chiral model with a Wess–Zumino term, by Bittleston and Skinner. In this talk I will discuss what happens if we try to deform and explore the new features that appear, including the role of novel boundary conditions in 4d Chern–Simons.
This talk is based on work with Lewis Cole, Ryan Cullinan, <span lang='es'>Joaquín Liniado</span> and Dan Thompson.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-01-24'>2024-01-24</time>: <span lang='tr'>Ömer Gürdoğan</span> (University of Southampton), Antipodal dualities: reading form factors backwards</summary>Our understanding of scattering amplitudes is in a process of perpetual refinement where new results lead to new insights, which in turn enable even more ambitious calculations. I will report on a recent observation that certain amplitudes and form factors are mapped to each other under the antipode of the Hopf algebra of multiple polylogarithms. This observation is based on an eight‐loop calculation of form factors, which turns out to be very amenable to the symbol bootstrap approach.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-01-31'>2024-01-31</time>: Georgios Papathanasiou <span lang='el'>Γεώργιος Παπαθανασίου</span> (City, University of London), Evaluating Feynman integrals with the help of the Landau equations</summary>Feynman integrals are the core of theoretical physics predictions for collider experiments, and at the same time exhibit remarkably deep mathematical structure. In this talk, I will describe how the knowledge of their singularities, as captured by the Landau equations, may aid the formidable task of their evaluation much more than was previously expected. In particular, I will provide evidence that the latter equations capture the building blocks or ‘letters’ of the integrals, when recast as a polynomial of their variables known as the principal <math><mi>𝐴</mi></math>‐determinant.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-02-07'>2024-02-07</time>: <span lang='pt'>Ricardo Monteiro</span> (Queen Mary University of London), On helicity violation in Yang–Mills and gravity</summary>I will discuss topics related to helicity violation in Yang–Mills and gravity. Firstly, I will discuss the connection of helicity violation, well known from the context of scattering amplitudes, to the concept of electric–magnetic duality — and in particular to its failure. Secondly, I will focus on the self‐dual sectors of Yang–Mills and gravity. These sectors satisfy classically a version of the electric–magnetic duality, but this symmetry is anomalous, giving rise to the all‐plus one‐loop amplitudes. Finally, I will discuss some lessons and intriguing aspects.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-02-21'>2024-02-21</time>: Nick Early (<span lang='de'>Max‐Planck‐Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften</span>), Scattering amplitudes and tilings of moduli spaces</summary>In 2013, Cachazo, He and Yuan (<abbr title='Cachazo–He–Yuan'>CHY</abbr>) discovered a remarkable framework for scattering amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory (<span title='quantum field theory'>QFT</span>) which mixes the real, complex and tropical geometry associated to the moduli space of <math><mi>𝑛</mi></math> points on the projective line, <math><msub><mi>ℳ</mi><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>𝑛</mi></mrow></msub></math>.  By duality, this moduli space has a twin moduli space of 𝑛 generic points in <math><msup><mi>ℙ</mi><mrow><mi>𝑛</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></math>, leading to dual realization of scattering amplitudes, using a generalization of the <abbr title='Cachazo–He–Yuan'>CHY</abbr> formalism introduced in 2019 by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (<abbr title='Cachazo–Early–Guevara–Mizera'>CEGM</abbr>).  Any duality begs for an investigation: what structures lie between the twin moduli spaces?  <abbr title='Cachazo–Early–Guevara–Mizera'>CEGM</abbr> developed a framework to answer the question for moduli spaces of <math><mi>𝑛</mi></math> points in any <math><msup><mi>ℙ</mi><mrow><mi>𝑘</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math>, leading to the discovery of rich, recursive structures which seem to suggest a new frontier in the study of scattering amplitudes.  In this talk, we discuss recent joint work with Cachazo and Zhang which uses ideas from oriented matroids to construct color-dressed generalized biadjoint scalar amplitudes.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-03-06'>2024-03-06</time>: <span lang='de'>Severin Bunk</span> (University of Hertfordshire), Infinitesimal higher symmetries</summary>Every bundle on a manifold has a universal symmetry group: for any Lie group <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>, giving a <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>‐equivariant structure on the bundle is equivalent to giving a Lie group homomorphism from <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math> to this universal symmetry group. The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher <math><mo>U</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‐bundles, or <math><mi>𝑛</mi></math>‐gerbes. This is joint work with <span lang='de'>Lukas Müller</span>, <span lang='nl'>Joost Nuiten</span> and Richard Szabo.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-03-13'>2024-03-13</time>: <span lang='ro'>Silvia Nagy</span> (Durham University), Asymptotic symmetries for subleading soft theorems</summary>It is by now well understood how leading soft theorems follow as Ward identities of asymptotic symmetries defined at null infinity. For subleading infrared effects the connection is more subtle, but it turns out that this can be formalised, to all orders, by adapting the Stueckelberg procedure to construct an extended radiative phase space at null infinity. I will show this at all orders for self‐dual Yang–Mills, self‐dual gravity, and finally Yang–Mills.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-03-20'>2024-03-20</time>: Donal O’Connell (<span lang='gd'>Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann</span>), Amplitudes and waveforms</summary>Waveforms are the most important precision observables in modern studies of general relativity. I will discuss how waveforms in gravitational scattering are closely very related to scattering amplitudes. The computation of next‐to‐leading order waveforms has revealed a number of interesting aspects of this connection, including generalisations of amplitudes, <abbr title='Bondi–Metzner–Sachs'>BMS</abbr> dependence of the waveform, and the importance of a new class of functions involving iterated integrals of Bessel functions.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-04-10'>2024-04-10</time>: <span lang='es'>Carlos Shahbazi</span> (<span lang='es'>Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia</span>), The Heterotic‐Ricci flow and its three‐dimensional solitons</summary>I will introduce a novel curvature flow, the Heterotic‐Ricci flow, as the two‐loop renormalization group flow of the Heterotic string common sector and study its three‐dimensional compact solitons. The Heterotic‐Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non‐negative real parameter <math><mi>𝜅</mi></math>, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three‐form <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math> on a manifold <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math>. Its most salient feature is that it involves a term quadratic in the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew‐symmetric torsion <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math>. When <math><mi>𝜅</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as an extension of the latter via a higher order correction prescribed by string theory, whereas when <math><mi>𝐻</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> and <math><mi>𝜅</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></math> the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG‐2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three‐form <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math>. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of self‐similar solutions of the Heterotic‐Ricci flow. I will present several structural results for three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons, providing the complete classification of three‐dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left‐invariant metric. Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‐constant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‐constant dilaton.

In Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism, it is natural to generalize Lagrangian relations to distributional half‐densities, as advocated by <span lang='sk'>Ševera</span>. We give a rigorous definition of linear distributional half‐densities and describe their composition, thus constructing a linear version of a quantum odd symplectic category. As an application, we describe the computation of the <abbr title='Batalin–Vilkovisky'>BV</abbr> effective action as a composition in this category.

In this talk I will review how partial biadjoint scalar amplitudes are computed using the global Schwinger formula, and also how one can recover amplitudes from it by using a limiting procedure on the kinematic invariants. Moreover, I will show how the regions in the positive tropical Grassmannian contributing to amplitudes are obtained from non-crossing <math><mo>(</mo><mi>𝑝</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‐chord diagrams, which can be extended to objects whose triangulations are in bijection with Feynman diagrams. Finally, I will point out a connection between these extended diagrams and off‐diagonal partial amplitudes, implying that  amplitudes can be expressed as a sum of products of cubic amplitudes.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-05-08'>2024-05-08</time>: Daniel Waldram (Imperial College London), <math><mi>𝑎</mi></math>‐maximisation and slope stability in generalised geometry</summary><math><mi>𝑎</mi></math>‐maximisation is a key property of 4d superconformal field theories that allows one to find the <math><mi>𝑅</mi></math>‐symmetry and central charge. Understanding the generic gravitational dual of this process is a key question in holography. I will describe some work in progress with Anthony Ashmore, Stephanie Baines and Michela Petrini, where we argue that it can be understood in terms of a notion of slope stability for <abbr title='anti de Sitter'>AdS</abbr> backgrounds in generalised geometry, in a way that physically connects closely to renormalisation group flow. For simplicity we will focus on the special case of Sasaki–Einstein geometries, where, using <math><mi>SL</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>𝑛</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math> generalised geometry, one reproduces (and extends) the volume minimisation procedure of Martelli–Sparks–Yau. Very broadly one can view the dual field theory and generalised geometry formulations as algebraic and differential descriptions of the same underlying geometry.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-05-24'>2024-05-24</time>: <span lang='sk'>Pavol Ševera</span> (<span lang='fr-CH'>Université de Genève</span>), On non‐topological boundary conditions of (perturbative) topological field theories</summary>In Witten’s <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr>/<abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> correspondence the chiral <abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> model appears from the chiral boundary condition imposed on the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr> theory. I will describe how similar boundary conditions of the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr> theory and of its analogs (given by the <abbr title='Alexandrov–Kontsevich–Schwarz–Zaboronsky'>AKSZ</abbr> constructions) produce many other interesting examples and how they explain, in particular, Poisson–Lie <math><mi>𝑇</mi></math>‐duality. Unlike the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr>/<abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> correspondence, this generalization is only perturbative; on the other hand, the perturbative renormalization leads to the generalized Ricci tensor and hopefully still hides many interesting things.

These higher categories exhibit noteworthy additional structures, depending upon the specific theories and defects under consideration. For instance, in oriented 2‐dimensional field theories, they organize into a pivotal bicategory. Currently, we lack a comprehensive framework to systematically describe these intricate structures. In my talk I will argue that the theory of higher dagger categories provides such a framework.

I will discuss a version of this result for homotopy‐theoretic variants of Lie group(oid)s, such as the string group, relating their cohomology to the cohomology of their (higher) Lie algebroids. The main challenge is to provide a well‐behaved analogue of Lie differentiation for higher groupoids; I will discuss how one can use ideas from Lurie and Pridham to provide such a construction.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-08-07'>2024-08-07</time>: <span lang='no'>Eirik Eik Svanes</span> (<span lang='no'>Universitetet i Stavanger</span>), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-09-25'>2024-09-25</time>: Kymani Tieral Keden Armstrong‐Williams (Queen Mary University of London), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-02'>2024-10-02</time>: <span lang='sk'>Martina Bártová</span> and <span lang='sk'>Samuel Valach</span> (<span lang='ga'>Coláiste na Tríonóide, Baile Átha Cliath</span>), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-09'>2024-10-09</time>: <span lang='de'>Sonja Klitsch</span> (<span lang='gd'>Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann</span>), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-30'>2024-10-30</time>: <span lang='es'>Mario García-Fernández</span> (<span lang='es'>Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</span>), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-06'>2024-11-06</time>: Nivedita (University of Oxford), TBA</summary>TBA</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-13'>2024-11-13</time>: Yang-Hui He <span lang='zh-Hans'>何杨辉</span> (University of Oxford; City, University of London), The <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> mathematician: from physics, to geometry, to number theory</summary>We summarize how <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> can approach mathematics in three ways: theorem‐proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing.
