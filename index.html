<h2>Upcoming seminars for the academic year 2024/2025</h2>
<details><summary><time datetime='2024-07-16 15:00:00'>16 July, 15:00</time>, E350: <span lang='nl'>Joost Nuiten</span> (<span lang='fr'>Université Toulouse Ⅲ Paul Sabatier</span>), The Van Est isomorphism for higher stacks</summary>A classical theorem of Van Est relates the differentiable cohomology of a Lie group to the cohomology of its Lie algebra. I will discuss a version of this result for homotopy‐theoretic variants of Lie group(oid)s, such as the string group, relating their cohomology to the cohomology of their (higher) Lie algebroids. The main challenge is to provide a well‐behaved analogue of Lie differentiation for higher groupoids; I will discuss how one can use ideas from Lurie and Pridham to provide such a construction.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-08-07 15:00:00'>7 August, 15:00</time>, E350: <span lang='no'>Eirik Eik Svanes</span> (<span lang='no'>Universitetet i Stavanger</span>), Heterotic distance conjectures and symplectic cohomology</summary>Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira–Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern–Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-09-25 14:00:00'>25 September, 14:00</time>, B404: <span lang='de'>Martin Wolf</span> (University of Surrey), Homotopy Algebra Perspective on Quantum Field Theory</summary>I will review recent progress on understanding perturbative quantum field theory within the realm of homotopy algebras. <a href='2024-09-25-Wolf.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-09-25 15:00:00'>25 September, 15:00</time>, B404: Kymani Tieral Keden Armstrong‐Williams (Queen Mary University of London), What can abelian gauge theories teach us about kinematic algebras?</summary>The last twenty years or so have given rise to an interesting relationship (known as the double copy) at the level of scattering amplitudes between non-abelian gauge theories (such as Yang–Mills theory) and quantum gravity theories. After half a decade, this duality was seen to be present in classical physics for exact solutions in classical Yang–Mills theory and general relativity. Arising from the Double Copy, the phenomenon of <abbr title='Bern–Carrasco–Johansson'>BCJ</abbr> duality implies that gauge theories are more complex than previously thought. They are now known to possess an abstract kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non‐abelian gauge theories, such that one typically works outwards from well‐known examples. In this talk, we explore using simpler abelian gauge theories to clarify our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well‐defined subalgebras of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subalgebras, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory. This talk will be based on work done in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10750'>arXiv:2401.10750</a>. <a href='2024-09-25-Armstrong‐Williams.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-02 14:00:00'>2 October, 14:00</time>, B404: <span lang='cs'>Martina Bártová</span> (Trinity College Dublin / <span lang='ga'>Coláiste na Tríonóide, Baile Átha Cliath</span>), Introduction to Quantum Integrability</summary>This talk provides an accessible introduction to quantum integrability, exploring the mathematical structure of integrable quantum systems. We will discuss key concepts such as conserved quantities, exact solvability, and the role of symmetries.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-02 15:00:00'>2 October, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='sk'>Samuel Valach</span> (Trinity College Dublin / <span lang='ga'>Coláiste na Tríonóide, Baile Átha Cliath</span>), Thermal Correlators, Holography and Black Hole Singularity</summary>Black hole singularities in <abbr title='anti de Sitter space'>AdS</abbr> are reflected in the so‐called bouncing geodesics. In the dual <abbr title='conformal field theory'>CFT</abbr> this leads to the bouncing singularities in the thermal correlators. I will explain both sides of this problem and show how these singularities arise from the analytic properties of the stress tensor and its composites in the boundary <abbr title='conformal field theory'>CFT</abbr>.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-09 15:00:00'>9 October, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='de'>Sonja Klisch</span> (University of Edinburgh / <span lang='gd'>Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann</span>), A double copy from twistor space</summary>In this talk I will present a new double copy relation at tree level between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes, graded by helicity. <p>Amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity in <math><mn>4</mn><mi>d</mi></math> can be partitioned into sectors according to their external helicity configurations. At tree level there are particularly beautiful expressions for these amplitudes coming from twistor strings known as the <abbr title='Roiban–Spradlin–Volovich–Witten'>RSVW</abbr> (Roiban–Spradlin–Volovich–Witten) formula for gauge theory, and Cachazo–Skinner formula for gravity. At the same time, the double copy gives an explicit relation between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes via <math><mtext>GR</mtext><mo>=</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>YM</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></math>. However, the explicit representation of the Cachazo-Skinner formula as a double copy of the <abbr title='Roiban–Spradlin–Volovich–Witten'>RSVW</abbr> formula has long been unknown. <p>The question answered in this talk is therefore: how do these helicity graded amplitudes manifest the double copy? In the journey there we will discover a new twistorial representation of biadjoint scalars, a way towards the double copy on non‐trivial backgrounds, and the importance of trees. <a href='2024-10-09-Klisch.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-16 15:00:00'>16 October, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='fa-Latn'>Mehran Jalali Farahani</span> <span lang='fa'>مهران جلالی فراهانی</span> (Heriot‐Watt University / <span lang='gd'>Oilthigh Heriot‐Watt</span>, Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences), Principal Lie groupoid bundles with connection (and a bit beyond)</summary>In this talk, I present our recent work towards general theory of higher principal bundles with connection. In particular, we developed the notion of principal groupoid‐bundles with connection using a new framework that is suitable for generalization. In this setup, principal bundles with connection are principal bundles without connection in a different category, namely the category of NQ‐manifolds. <a href='2024-10-16-Jalali-Farahani.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-23 15:00:00'>23 October, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='pt'>Catarina Carvalho</span> (University of Hertfordshire), Digraphs with caterpillar duality</summary>We search for the class of digraphs whose obstruction sets, in the digraph homomorphism problem, consist of caterpillars. The conjecture being that this class of digraphs should be the same as the class of digraphs that are preserved by majority and set function polymorphisms. This is work in progress. <a href='https://caterpillardualitysemigroupseminar.netlify.app/'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-10-30 15:00:00'>30 October, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='es'>Mario García‐Fernández</span> (<span lang='es'>Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</span>), Pluriclosed flow and the Hull–Strominger system</summary>I will overview joint work with Raúl González Molina and Jeffrey Streets in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11674'>arXiv:2408.11674</a> about a natural extension of pluriclosed flow, where the evolution of the hermitian metric on the complex manifold <math><mi>X</mi></math> is further coupled to a hermitian metric on a holomorphic vector bundle <math><mi>V</mi></math> over <math><mi>X</mi></math>. Flow lines are special solutions of the generalized Ricci flow in generalized geometry, and hence of the renormalization group flow in the heterotic sigma model. Using this, we interpret the flow as a version of Donaldson’s Hermitian–Yang–Mills flow in the realm of higher gauge theory. We will comment on the higher regularity structure of the flow and on global existence and convergence results on special backgrounds. If time allows, we will also discuss the relationship to the Hull–Strominger system and, conjecturally, to the geometrization of Reid’s fantasy. <a href='2024-10-30-García.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-06 15:00:00'>6 November, 15:00</time>, B404: Nivedita <span lang='hi'>निवेदिता</span> / <span lang='pa'>ਨਿਵੇਦਿਤਾ</span> (University of Oxford), Towards Models for <math><mo>2‐Hilb</mo></math> and <math><mo>3‐Hilb</mo></math> as targets for functorial field theories</summary>We introduce <math><mi>W</mi><mo>*</mo><mo>-Cat</mo></math>, the bicategory of <math><mi>W</mi><mo>*</mo></math>‐categories, functors and natural transformations and discuss its equivalence with the Morita category of von Neumann algebras (<math><mo>vN2</mo></math>). We highlight some analogies of <math><mi>W</mi><mo>*</mo></math>‐categories with Hilbert spaces. We introduce categorified von Neumann algebras, building up to a definition of a Bicommutant Category and discuss a string calculus on a cylinder. We finally sketch some examples of bicommutant categories associated to chiral <abbr title='conformal field theories'>CFTs</abbr>. <a href='2024-11-06-Nivedita.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-13 15:00:00'>13 November, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='zh-Latn-pinyin'>Yang‐Hui He</span> <span lang='zh-Hant'>何楊輝</span> (University of Oxford; City, University of London), The <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> mathematician: from physics, to geometry, to number theory</summary>We summarize how <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> can approach mathematics in three ways: theorem‐proving, conjecture formulation, and language processing. Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and string theory, we present a number of recent experiments on how various standard machine‐learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines ranging from algebraic geometry to representation theory, to combinatorics, and to number theory. At the heart of the programme is the question: how does <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> help with mathematical discovery? <a href='2024-11-13-He.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-20 15:00:00'>20 November, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='nl'>Pieter Marc Bomans</span> (University of Oxford), Unravelling the holomorphic twist</summary>In this talk I will introduce the holomorphic twist for generic 4d <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></math> <abbr title='supersymmetric quantum field theories'>SQFTs</abbr> and discuss the infinite dimensional symmetry enhancement. Consequentially, holomorphically twisted theories come equipped with a variety of mathematical structures. After discussing the relevant structures, I will explain how to relate them to data in the physical theory. In particular. I will discuss how the central charges can be obtained from the ternary bracket. Time permitting, I will finish by demonstrating how the associated <abbr title='vertex operator algebra'>VOA</abbr> can be obtained from the holomorphic twist in the presence of extended supersymmetry. <a href='2024-11-20-Bomans.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-11-27 15:00:00'>27 November, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='zh-Latn-pinyin'>Jingxiang Wu</span> (<span lang='zh-Hans'>吴敬祥</span>) (University of Oxford), Higher operations in quantum field theories</summary>I will give an overview of higher operations in quantum field theories which control their deformations, (generalized) OPEs, and anomalies. Particular attention is paid to holomorphic-topological theories where we can systematically describe and regularize the Feynman diagrams which compute these higher operations in free and perturbative scenarios, including examples with defects.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-12-04 15:00:00'>4 December, 15:00</time>, B404: Niklas Garner (University of Oxford),  Higgs and Coulomb branches from Superconformal Raviolo Vertex Algebras</summary>The Higgs and Coulomb branches of vacua are central objects in the mathematics of three-dimensional <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></math> supersymmetric quantum field theories and, in particular, three-dimensional mirror symmetry. In this talk, I will describe how these interesting (<math><mn>2</mn></math>‐shifted) Poisson schemes can be extracted by exploiting a natural action of an infinite‐dimensional Lie algebra that is a three‐dimensional analogue of the <math><mi>𝒩</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></math> superconformal algebra familiar from two‐dimensional superconformal field theory. This is based off of joint work with S. Raghavendran and B. Williams. <a href='2024-12-04-Garner.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-01-08 15:00:00'>8 January, 15:00</time>, A161: <span lang='hy-Latn'>Karapet Mkrtchyan</span> <span lang='hy'>Կարապետ Մկրտչյան</span> (Imperial College London), Democratic approach to <math><mi>𝑝</mi></math>‐form dynamics</summary>We will summarize a recently developed approach to <math><mi>𝑝</mi></math>‐form dynamics, which allows for a democratic (treating electric and magnetic degrees of freedom on an equal footing) Lagrangian formulation for electrodynamics and generalization to (chiral) <math><mi>𝑝</mi></math>‐forms, including arbitrary abelian interactions. In particular, a Lagrangian for arbitrary duality‐symmetric non‐linear electrodynamics in <math><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math> dimensions is derived where both <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>SO</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></math> duality and Lorentz covariance are manifest. Democratic formulation for (type Ⅱ) <abbr title='supergravity'>SUGRA</abbr> in 10d and 11d is also achieved. We also present a simple derivation of this formulation from a topological theory in one higher dimension. Time permitting, more discussion on an ongoing work on generalizations of these results will be provided. <a href='2025-01-08-Mkrtchyan.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-01-15 15:00:00'>15 January, 15:00</time>, B400: <span lang='it'>Erica Bertolini</span> (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies / <span lang='ga'>Institiúid Ard‐Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath</span>), Fractons: a new covariant gauge field theory</summary>The concept of a fracton quasiparticle has recently emerged in many areas of physics, from mathematical physics to condensed matter and quantum information, unified by the general feature of restricted mobility.<p>In this seminar I will introduce the basic notion of fracton quasiparticles, focussing on the gauge field theory construction developed in Pretko's original papers [1604.05329,1606.08857], mentioning the physical applications in elasticity theory and connections with gravitational models. In the second part of the seminar I will then step into the building of a covariant model for fractons in which a strong relation with Linearized Gravity naturally emerges. The fracton phenomenology is reproduced from first principles of <abbr title='quantum field theory'>QFT</abbr> through a symmetry‐based approach, opening the doors to a new class of covariant gauge field theories. This formulation can be generalized to any spacetime dimension, allowing for instance the study of lower‐dimentional fracton models and showing relations with some condensed matter systems. <a href='2025-01-15-Bertolini.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-01-22 15:00:00'>22 January, 15:00</time>, B404: <span lang='it'>Tancredi Schettini Gherardini</span> (Queen Mary University of London), Exotic spheres from different angles</summary>In this talk, I will discuss different mathematical properties of exotic (<math><mn>7</mn></math>‐)spheres and their implications in physics.

High Energ. Phys.</abbr> 2023, 100) and <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01909'>arXiv:2410.01909</a>; I will discuss the relevance of these results in the context of supergravity. <li>The differentiable structure of exotic spheres together with its conjectured implications in general relativity and shock waves (work in progress). <li>A numerical technique for finding and approximating Einstein metrics, to be applied eventually to the case of exotic spheres, which is based on state‐of‐the‐art machine learning tools (work in progress with Edward Hirst and Alex Stapleton).

This leads to new highly constraining differential equations for them, making integrability visible at the level of individual Feynman graphs. Our results apply to planar Feynman diagrams in any spacetime dimension dual to an arbitrary network of intersecting straight lines on a plane (Baxter lattice), with propagator powers determined by the geometry. The graphs we consider determine correlators in the recently proposed “loom” fishnet <abbr title='conformal field theories'>CFTs</abbr>. The construction unifies and greatly extends the known special cases of Yangian invariance to likely the most general family of integrable scalar planar graphs. We also relate these equations in certain cases to famous GKZ (Gelfand–Kapranov–Zelevinsky) hypergeometric operators, opening the way to using new powerful solution methods. <a href='2025-01-29-Levkovich-Maslyuk.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-02-05 15:00:00'>5 February, 15:00</time>, B400: Siani Smith (Loughborough University), A complexity framework for forbidden subgraphs</summary>A common direction in algorithmic graph theory is to investigate the complexity of hard problems restricted to specific classes of graphs. This raises the question of whether large sets of such problems can be explained by common problem conditions. For a set of graphs <math><mi>ℋ</mi></math>, the class of <math><mi>ℋ</mi></math>‐subgraph‐free graphs is the class of all graphs not containing any graph from <math><mi>ℋ</mi></math> as a subgraph. We present a framework to classify the complexity of certain problems on <math><mi>ℋ</mi></math>‐subgraph‐free graph classes. In particular, we give a meta‐theorem classifying the complexity of problems satisfying three conditions.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-02-12 15:00:00'>12 February, 15:00</time>, B400: <span lang='es'>Víctor Carmona Sánchez</span> (<span lang='de'>Max‐Planck‐Institut für Mathematik in den Naturwissenschaften Leipzig</span>), The <math><mo>∞</mo></math>‐equivalence between AQFTs and Factorization Algebras</summary>Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is an exciting yet elusive domain within mathematics and physics. Despite the lack of rigorous foundations to support many advancements made by physicists, mathematicians have engaged in a fruitful endeavor to formalize QFTs. In current times, we find ourselves at a crossroads: while we still lack the comprehensive techniques and language to fully grasp QFT, numerous distinct axiomatic frameworks are attempting to capture its essence. A natural question arises: how are these approaches connected? This talk will focus on two such frameworks: Algebraic Quantum Field Theories (AQFTs) and Factorization Algebras (FAs). The significance of these frameworks is motivated, among other things, by rigorous programs led by Fredenhagen–Rejzner and Costello–Gwilliam to construct perturbative QFTs using AQFTs and FAs, respectively. Recent contributions from Gwilliam–Rejzner and Benini–Musante–Schenkel establish a relationship between these two programs, vaguely speaking. At a more structural level, Benini–Perin–Schenkel have established an equivalence of 1-categories between specific subcategories of AQFTs and (time‐orderable pre‐)FAs. The goal of this talk is to present our proof of an even broader equivalence between <math><mo>∞</mo></math>‐categories of AQFTs and tpFAs.<p>This talk is based on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318'>arXiv:2412.07318</a> and ongoing joint work with M. Benini, A. Grant‐Stuart and A. Schenkel.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-02-19 15:00:00'>19 February, 15:00</time>, B400: Lewis Topley (University of Bath), Twisted Yangians and even finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras in classical types</summary> I will report on a work in progress, join with Kang Lu, Yang‐ning Peng, Lukas Tappeiner and Weiqiang Wang, which connects the two algebras in the title of this talk. Finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras are an interesting family of algebras, built from a complex semisimple Lie algebra and a nilpotent element by a process of quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Twisted Yangians are a family of algebras of a totally different pedigree. They were introduced by Olshanskii in order to quantize the twisted current algebra coming from symmetric pairs, and they arise as coideal subalgebras of the Yangians studied extensively by Drinfeld. A famous theorem of Brundan and Kleshchev states that the finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras of type A arise as quotients of the (shifted) Yangian associated to general linear algebras. For finite W-algebras associated to even nilpotent elements in types B, C, D it turns out that the (shifted) twisted Yangians are the correct replacement. Our work generalises results of Brown which dealt with the rectangular case. I will attempt to make the talk as accessible as possible.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2025-02-26 15:00:00'>26 February, 15:00</time>, C152: Rachel Shaw (University of Southampton), Power and Mobility Optimisation in a Multi‐Agent Game</summary>In the dynamic setting of competitive multi-agent systems, strategic decision‐making and resource allocation are key to achieving optimal outcomes. This research explores the optimisation of power and mobility in adversarial multi‐agent games, modelled as a Nash zero‐sum framework. By utilising advanced game‐theoretic methods, we analyse the interactions between the agents of two teams of autonomous vehicles, with decision variables encompassing communication, interference, and movement. The model incorporates power, movement, and minimum distance constraints, employing fixed‐point formulations and block‐descent algorithms to determine equilibrium strategies.

These higher categories exhibit noteworthy additional structures, depending upon the specific theories and defects under consideration. For instance, in oriented 2‐dimensional field theories, they organize into a pivotal bicategory. Currently, we lack a comprehensive framework to systematically describe these intricate structures. In my talk I will argue that the theory of higher dagger categories provides such a framework. The talk is partially based on joint work in progress with <span lang='it'>Gio Ferrer</span>, Brett Hungar, Theo Johnson‐Freyd, Cameron Krulewski, Nivedita, Dave Penneys, David Reutter, <span lang='de'>Claudia Scheimbauer</span>, <span lang='nl'>Luuk Stehouwer</span>, and Chetan Vuppulury.</details><details><summary><time datetime='2024-05-24 14:30:00'>24 May 2024, 14:30</time>: <span lang='sk'>Pavol Ševera</span> (<span lang='fr-CH'>Université de Genève</span>), On non‐topological boundary conditions of (perturbative) topological field theories</summary>In Witten’s <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr>/<abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> correspondence the chiral <abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> model appears from the chiral boundary condition imposed on the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr> theory. I will describe how similar boundary conditions of the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr> theory and of its analogs (given by the <abbr title='Alexandrov–Kontsevich–Schwarz–Zaboronsky'>AKSZ</abbr> constructions) produce many other interesting examples and how they explain, in particular, Poisson–Lie <math><mi>𝑇</mi></math>‐duality. Unlike the <abbr title='Chern–Simons'>CS</abbr>/<abbr title='Wess–Zumino–Witten'>WZW</abbr> correspondence, this generalization is only perturbative; on the other hand, the perturbative renormalization leads to the generalized Ricci tensor and hopefully still hides many interesting things.

Understanding the generic gravitational dual of this process is a key question in holography. I will describe some work in progress with Anthony Ashmore, Stephanie Baines and Michela Petrini, where we argue that it can be understood in terms of a notion of slope stability for <abbr title='anti de Sitter'>AdS</abbr> backgrounds in generalised geometry, in a way that physically connects closely to renormalisation group flow. For simplicity we will focus on the special case of Sasaki–Einstein geometries, where, using <math><mi>SL</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>𝑛</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math> generalised geometry, one reproduces (and extends) the volume minimisation procedure of Martelli–Sparks–Yau.

In this talk I will review how partial biadjoint scalar amplitudes are computed using the global Schwinger formula, and also how one can recover amplitudes from it by using a limiting procedure on the kinematic invariants. Moreover, I will show how the regions in the positive tropical Grassmannian contributing to amplitudes are obtained from non‐crossing <math><mo>(</mo><mi>𝑝</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‐chord diagrams, which can be extended to objects whose triangulations are in bijection with Feynman diagrams.

The Heterotic‐Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non‐negative real parameter <math><mi>𝜅</mi></math>, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three‐form <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math> on a manifold <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math>.

When <math><mi>𝜅</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as an extension of the latter via a higher order correction prescribed by string theory, whereas when <math><mi>𝐻</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math> and <math><mi>𝜅</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></math> the Heterotic‐Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG‐2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three‐form <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math>. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of self‐similar solutions of the Heterotic‐Ricci flow. I will present several structural results for three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons, providing the complete classification of three‐dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left‐invariant metric. Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‐constant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‐constant dilaton.

For subleading infrared effects the connection is more subtle, but it turns out that this can be formalised, to all orders, by adapting the Stueckelberg procedure to construct an extended radiative phase space at null infinity.

The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher <math><mo>U</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‐bundles, or <math><mi>𝑛</mi></math>‐gerbes.

Secondly, I will focus on the self‐dual sectors of Yang–Mills and gravity.

Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:<ol><li>Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang–Mills squared</mtext></math>!</li> <li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol><p>We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>◽️</mo></msup></math>‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality. <a href='2023-11-22-Borsten.pdf'>(slides)</a></details><details><summary><time datetime='2023-11-15 13:30:00'>15 November 2023, 13:30</time>: <span lang='de'>Julian Matteo Kupka</span> (University of Hertfordshire), Non‐relativistic geometry and why you might care</summary>This talk explores non‐relativistic geometry, a mathematical framework allowing us to formulate Newtonian physics analogously to General Relativity, <abbr title='id est'>i.e.</abbr> geometrizing it.

In particular, it is noted that such a submanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for the dominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluid flows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use of higher (categorified) symplectic geometry.

This result inspired a series of investigations of the word problem in other one‐relator algebraic structures. For example, in the 1960s Shirshov proved the word problem is decidable in one‐relator Lie algebras. In contrast, it remains a longstanding open problem whether the word problem is decidable for one‐relator monoids. An important class of algebraic structures lying in between monoids and groups is that of inverse monoids.
