title = "What can abelian gauge theories teach us about kinematic algebras?"
abstract = "The last twenty years or so have given rise to an interesting relationship (known as the double copy) at the level of scattering amplitudes between non-abelian gauge theories (such as Yang–Mills theory) and quantum gravity theories. After half a decade, this duality was seen to be present in classical physics for exact solutions in classical Yang–Mills theory and general relativity. Arising from the Double Copy, the phenomenon of <abbr title='Bern–Carrasco–Johansson'>BCJ</abbr> duality implies that gauge theories are more complex than previously thought. They are now known to possess an abstract kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non‐abelian gauge theories, such that one typically works outwards from well‐known examples. In this talk, we explore using simpler abelian gauge theories to clarify our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well‐defined subalgebras of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subalgebras, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory. This talk will be based on work done in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10750'>arXiv:2401.10750</a>. <a href='2024-09-25-Armstrong‐Williams.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

We will comment on the higher regularity structure of the flow and on global existence and convergence results on special backgrounds.

Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form."

The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance.

abstract = "The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:<ol><li>Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang–Mills squared</mtext></math>!</li> <li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol><p>We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>◽️</mo></msup></math>‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality. <a href='2023-11-22-Borsten.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

For example, in the 1960s Shirshov proved the word problem is decidable in one‐relator Lie algebras. In contrast, it remains a longstanding open problem whether the word problem is decidable for one‐relator monoids. An important class of algebraic structures lying in between monoids and groups is that of inverse monoids. In this talk I will speak about a recent result which shows that there exist one‐relator inverse monoids of the form <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>Inv</mi><mo>⟨</mo><mi>𝐴</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>𝑤</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>⟩</mo></math> with undecidable word problem.

In this talk, I will briefly review the formalism, and then describe how the constrained spinors are Koszuldual to certain superalgebras, generically <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math> algebras, constructed fromthe supermultiplets, and how these algebras introduce non‐linear structures on the supermultiplets. This is work in collaboration with <span lang='sv'>S. Jonsson</span>, <span lang='sv'>J. Palmkvist</span> and I. Saberi."

title = "Quantum cohomology and loop group action"
abstract = "Quantum cohomology is an invariant of symplectic manifolds. It is a commutative deformation of theusual cohomology as an algebra, where the deformation is controlled by counting certain holomorphic spheres. In this talk, we will first explain how it is related to the loop space, and to Floer cohomology. Then we will sketch that,in the presence of a Hamiltonian <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>‐action on a symplectic manifold <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math> with acompact Lie group <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>,  how we can obtain an action on the <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>‐‐equivariant quantum cohomology from the <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>‐equivariant Borel–Moore homology of the based loop space of <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>. No knowledge on symplectic geometry is assumed. This is a joint work with <span lang='es'>Eduardo González</span> and Dan Pomerleano."

title = "From amplitudes to cosmology"
abstract = "Whereas scattering amplitudes probe physics at the shortest distances, cosmology probes physics at the largest scales. Nevertheless, many concepts discovered in the study of scattering amplitudes generalise to cosmological observables. In this talk I will describe some aspects of this program which I have recently been investigating such as the double copy, scattering equations, and soft limits, and will discuss how these directions are interrelated."

title = "Skew Hecke Algebras"
abstract = "Given a finite group <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>, a subgroup <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math>, and an action of <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math> on an algebra <math><mi>𝐴</mi></math>, we define an associated ‘skew Hecke algebra’. This construction provides a simultaneous generalisation of Hecke algebras of finite groups and of skew group algebras. I will explain some of the basic properties of these algebras, some results about their structure, and the relation to rings of invariants. I will also discuss the representation theory of these algebras and their homological properties such as global dimension. If there is time I will explain the relevance of these algebras to the study of quantum reference frames, and possible analogues of skew Hecke algebras for von Neumann algebras. This is based on work inprogress, joint with Leon Loveridge (University of South‐Eastern Norway) and <span lang='pl'>Jan Głowacki</span> (PAN Centre for Theoretical Physics, Warsaw)."

title = "Monge–Ampère Geometry and the Navier–Stokes equations"
abstract = "Partial differential equations of Monge–Ampère type have been shown to correspond to specific choices of differential form on the associated phase space. Furthermore, Lagrangian submanifolds of said space may be viewed as a generalisation of solutions to a Monge–Ampère equation. Building from the observation that the Poisson equation for the pressure of an incompressible, two‐dimensional, Navier–Stokes flow can be presented as an equationof Monge–Ampère type, this talk introduces a framework for studying fluid dynamics using properties of the aforementioned submanifolds. In particular, it is noted that such a submanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for the dominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluid flows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use of higher (categorified) symplectic geometry. We conclude with some comments on how this facilitates symmetry reductions and some open questions."
