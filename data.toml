title = "What can abelian gauge theories teach us about kinematic algebras?"
abstract = "The last twenty years or so have given rise to an interesting relationship (known as the double copy) at the level of scattering amplitudes between non-abelian gauge theories (such as Yang–Mills theory) and quantum gravity theories. After half a decade, this duality was seen to be present in classical physics for exact solutions in classical Yang–Mills theory and general relativity. Arising from the Double Copy, the phenomenon of <abbr title='Bern–Carrasco–Johansson'>BCJ</abbr> duality implies that gauge theories are more complex than previously thought. They are now known to possess an abstract kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non‐abelian gauge theories, such that one typically works outwards from well‐known examples. In this talk, we explore using simpler abelian gauge theories to clarify our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well‐defined subalgebras of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subalgebras, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory. This talk will be based on work done in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10750'>arXiv:2401.10750</a>. <a href='2024-09-25-Armstrong‐Williams.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

At tree level there are particularly beautiful expressions for these amplitudes coming from twistor strings known as the <abbr title='Roiban–Spradlin–Volovich–Witten'>RSVW</abbr> (Roiban–Spradlin–Volovich–Witten) formula for gauge theory, and Cachazo–Skinner formula for gravity.

We will comment on the higher regularity structure of the flow and on global existence and convergence results on special backgrounds. If time allows, we will also discuss the relationship to the Hull–Strominger system and, conjecturally, to the geometrization of Reid’s fantasy. <a href='2024-10-30-García.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

In the second part of the seminar I will then step into the building of a covariant model for fractons in which a strong relation with Linearized Gravity naturally emerges. The fracton phenomenology is reproduced from first principles of <abbr title='quantum field theory'>QFT</abbr> through a symmetry‐based approach, opening the doors to a new class of covariant gauge field theories.

The graphs we consider determine correlators in the recently proposed “loom” fishnet <abbr title='conformal field theories'>CFTs</abbr>.

abstract = " I will report on a work in progress, join with Kang Lu, Yang‐ning Peng, Lukas Tappeiner and Weiqiang Wang, which connects the two algebras in the title of this talk. Finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras are an interesting family of algebras, built from a complex semisimple Lie algebra and a nilpotent element by a process of quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Twisted Yangians are a family of algebras of a totally different pedigree. They were introduced by Olshanskii in order to quantize the twisted current algebra coming from symmetric pairs, and they arise as coideal subalgebras of the Yangians studied extensively by Drinfeld. A famous theorem of Brundan and Kleshchev states that the finite <math><mi>W</mi></math>‐algebras of type A arise as quotients of the (shifted) Yangian associated to general linear algebras. For finite W-algebras associated to even nilpotent elements in types B, C, D it turns out that the (shifted) twisted Yangians are the correct replacement. Our work generalises results of Brown which dealt with the rectangular case. I will attempt to make the talk as accessible as possible."

abstract = "Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is an exciting yet elusive domain within mathematics and physics. Despite the lack of rigorous foundations to support many advancements made by physicists, mathematicians have engaged in a fruitful endeavor to formalize QFTs. In current times, we find ourselves at a crossroads: while we still lack the comprehensive techniques and language to fully grasp QFT, numerous distinct axiomatic frameworks are attempting to capture its essence. A natural question arises: how are these approaches connected? This talk will focus on two such frameworks: Algebraic Quantum Field Theories (AQFTs) and Factorization Algebras (FAs). The significance of these frameworks is motivated, among other things, by rigorous programs led by Fredenhagen–Rejzner and Costello–Gwilliam to construct perturbative QFTs using AQFTs and FAs, respectively. Recent contributions from Gwilliam–Rejzner and Benini–Musante–Schenkel establish a relationship between these two programs, vaguely speaking. At a more structural level, Benini–Perin–Schenkel have established an equivalence of 1-categories between specific subcategories of AQFTs and (time‐orderable pre‐)FAs. The goal of this talk is to present our proof of an even broader equivalence between <math><mo>∞</mo></math>‐categories of AQFTs and tpFAs.<p>This talk is based on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318'>arXiv:2412.07318</a> and ongoing joint work with M.

abstract = "The notion of a superconformal structure on a supermanifold goes back some forty years. I will discuss some recent work that shows how these structures and their deformations govern supersymmetric and superconformal field theories in geometric fashion. A superconformal structure equips a supermanifold with a sheaf of dg commutative algebras; the tangent sheaf of this dg ringed space reproduces the Weyl multiplet of conformal supergravity (equivalently, the superconformal stress tensor multiplet), in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry. This construction is uniform under twists, and thus provides a classification of relations between superconformal theories, chiral algebras, higher Virasoro algebras, and more exotic examples. "

abstract = "<math><mn>1</mn></math>‐form symmetries are new types of symmetries, long known to even undergraduate students, but only recently formalized. Their distinguishing property is that (Wilson) loop operators carry charge under this global symmetry. As ordinary (<math><mn>0</mn></math>‐form) symmetries, they can be spontaneously broken or restored. Importantly such symmetries allow a rigorous definition of the confining phase, as the phase where the symmetry is restored, and Wilson loops obey area law. The alternative is that the symmetry is spontaneously broken, and Wilson loops get an expectation value, proportional to their length (the perimeter law). In 4d, the symmetry is discrete (e.g. <math><msub><mo>ℤ</mo><mi>𝑁</mi></msub></math>) the spontaneously broken phase is a <abbr title='topological quantum field theory'>TQFT</abbr>, while if it is continuous (e.g. <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>U</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>) is a photon phase, where photons are viewed as Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken symmetry group. Surprisingly, however, even systems with only a discrete <math><mn>1</mn></math>‐form symmetry generically have a photon phase. Moreover this photon phase can be seen as proliferation of string‐like objects — popularily called center vortices in <abbr title='quantum chromodynamics'>QCD</abbr> literature — which are commonly claimed to cause confinement. Rather I will argue theoretically, and demonstrate numerically that such objects cause the emergence of a <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>U</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math> theory, while another type of particle like object — the monopole — may cause confinement.

Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form."

Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‐constant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‐constant dilaton.

The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance.

We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>◽️</mo></msup></math>‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality. <a href='2023-11-22-Borsten.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

In contrast, it remains a longstanding open problem whether the word problem is decidable for one‐relator monoids. An important class of algebraic structures lying in between monoids and groups is that of inverse monoids. In this talk I will speak about a recent result which shows that there exist one‐relator inverse monoids of the form <math><mi mathvariant='normal'>Inv</mi><mo>⟨</mo><mi>𝐴</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>𝑤</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>⟩</mo></math> with undecidable word problem.

In particular, it is noted that such a submanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for the dominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluid flows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use of higher (categorified) symplectic geometry.

abstract = "While strong uniqueness theorems hold for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in four dimensions, the results break down in higher dimensions and when the asymptotically flat condition is relaxed. Nonetheless, there has been significant progress in classifying the near-horizon geometries of extremal black holes. Motivated by this, we start with near-horizon geometries, which are better understood, and deform them to obtain extremal black hole solutions.  We investigate whether a given near-horizon geometry uniquely corresponds to a black hole solution or if there are multiple black holes with the same near-horizon geometry. Our approach employs the homotopy algebraic framework, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Using homological perturbation theory, we recursively solve the deformation problem order by order. To illustrate the method, we present a concrete example of the deformation of the extremal Kerr horizon."

In string theory, (super)gravity and its quantum corrections emerge from specific vibration modes of relativistic strings, described by vertex operator algebras in two-dimensional conformal field theories. However, the precise map between these two is highly non-trivial and is only known explicitly to the first orders in a perturbative expansion. I will reveal a new, infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra that at least reproduces the leading two orders of quantum corrections. Remarkably, it has the potential to evade a no-go theorem that rules out competing approaches to uncover hidden symmetries in supergravity beyond second-order corrections. Given that many of the algebraic structures encountered here have a natural generalization from strings to membranes, this suggests a similar approach to analyzing quantum corrections in 11-dimensional supergravity - the low-energy limit of M-theory. Beyond fundamental insights, these results have broad applications, including the construction of new supergravity solutions, the analysis of their spectrum, the computation of renormalization group flows in two-dimensional σ-models, and the study of integrable strings. A generalization of Cartan geometry is found on the mathematical side."

title = "Analytic approaches to the relativistic Boltzmann equation"
abstract = """The emergence of a universal pre-hydrodynamic attractor behaviour during fluid thermalisation is an important feature in the study of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions and cold atom experiments: highly non-hydrodynamic behaviour dictated by initial conditions quickly decays towards this attractor solution, with the resulting hydrodynamic system independent of the initial state.

There are many approaches to study the emergence of this attractor. We will briefly review these approaches, then focusing on kinetic theory. Starting with the relativist Boltzmann equation in the so-called relaxation time approximation, we introduce a series of moments and their generating function, which we show solved a single PDE. We solve this PDE perturbatively for all moments, both in the small and large time approximations, and we then recover the free streaming and attractor regimes at each end via methods of analytic continuation."""

abstract = """A colouring of a graph with <math><mi>k</mi></math> colours is an assignment of colours to vertices so that no edge is monochromatic. As it is well-known colouring with 2 colours is in P while colouring with <math><mi>k &gt; 2</mi></math> colours is NP-complete. This dichotomy was extended to the <it>graph homomorphism problem</it>, also called <math><mi>H</mi></math>-colouring, by Hell and Nešetřil [J. Comb. Theory B, 48(1):92-110, 1990]. More precisely, they proved that deciding whether there is a graph homomorphism from a given graph to a fixed graph <math><mi>H</mi></math> is in P if <math><mi>H</mi></math> is bipartite (or contains a self-loop), and is NP-complete otherwise. This dichotomy served as an important test-case for the Feder–Vardi dichotomy conjecture, and Bulatov–Zhuk dichotomy of complexity of finite-template CSPs.
 
In the talk, I will present a new proof of this theorem using tools from topological combinatorics based on ideas of Lovász [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 25(3):319-324, 1978] and Brower’s fixed-point theorem. This is joint work with Sebastian Meyer (TU Dresden)."""

abstract = "Given a special holonomy manifold, we can obtain an associated superconformal algebra of symmetries (SW-algebra) by considering a string theory compactification. This is a fascinating correspondence between geometry and conformal field theory that has spectacular consequences: for instance, mirror symmetry was originally discovered this way! Although the correspondence is well understood for torsion-free G-structures and compactifications without fluxes, very little is known for more general G-structures in the presence of NS flux. In this talk I will present the first steps to identify these conformal algebras. We will do so through a study of the classical sigma model, focusing on the case of G2 manifolds. Time permitting, I will discuss how to reformulate these results in the language of Vertex Operator Algebras and present some explicit examples.\nThis talk is based on 2412.13904, joint with Xenia de la Ossa and Enrico Marchetto, and on 2502.02769, joint with Andoni de Arriba de la Hera and Mario Garcia-Fernandez.

The action is not fully background independent and it does not have standard diffeomorphism symmetry - instead there is an exotic gauge symmetry that acts on some fields but not others. 

These issues greatly restrict the spacetimes that this action can be applied to.

A new action is found that reduces to Sen’s in a certain limit but which has diffeomorphism symmetry together with further exotic symmetries and is background independent. As a result, it can be applied to any spacetime."""

A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging.

I will also present several applications of this symmetry, which include the protection of some coupling constants of the sigma model from quantum corrections as well as new Ward identities.

title = "Semigroups Of Generalised Symmetries"
abstract = """Symmetry is a recurring concept in both Science and Art. Upon hearing the term, one initially tends to think of rotations and reflections found in Geometry. However, if we recall that, formally, the symmetries of a geometric shape <math><mi>X</mi></math> are just the distance preserving bijections <math><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi> <mo>&rarr;</mo> <mi>X</mi></math>, then we see that this idea naturally generalises from Geometry to virtually all areas of Mathematics: The symmetries of any kind of mathematical object <math><mi>X</mi></math> are the bijections <math><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>X</mi> <mo>&rarr;</mo> <mi>X</mi></math> which preserve the structure of <math><mi>X</mi></math>.

For example, the symmetries of a graph, group, or vector space are its automorphisms and the symmetries of a topological space its homeomorphisms. In each case, the symmetries of <math><mi>X</mi></math> form a subgroup of the symmetric group <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math> of all permutations of <math><mi>X</mi></math>. By Cayley's Theorem, all groups are isomorphic to subgroups of symmetric groups, and so Group Theory is essentially the study of symmetries.

There are two widely-studied and natural generalisations of the concept of symmetry above which correspond to generalisations of groups to semigroups and inverse semigroups, respectively. First, one might drop the requirement that symmetries need to be invertible. For example, one might consider all continuous transformations of some topological space <math><mi>X</mi></math>. This takes us from subgroups of <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math> to subsemigroups of the <i>Full Transformation Monoid</i> <math><mi>X</mi><mo><sup></mo><mi>X</mi></sup></math> of all functions from <math><mi>X</mi></math> to <math><mi>X</mi></math>.

Alternatively, one might be interested not just in the symmetries of the whole structure <math><mi>X</mi></math>, but also in partial symmetries, i.e. symmetries between substructures of <math><mi>X</mi></math>. This approach takes us to studying inverse subsemigroups of the <i>Symmetric Inverse Monoid</i> <math><mi>I</mi><sub><mi>X</mi></sub></math> consisting of all bijections between subsets of <math><mi>X</mi></math>.

In this talk, we will consider <math><mo>Sym</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo></math>, <math><mi>X</mi><mo><sup></mo><mi>X</mi></sup></math>, and <math><mi>I</mi><sub><mi>X</mi></sub></math> on an infinite set <math><mi>X</mi></math>. I will present a variety of results which highlight the connections between semigroups (including groups and inverse semigroups) on the one hand and Set Theory, Model Theory, and Topology on the other. No previous knowledge of Semigroup Theory will be assumed."""
