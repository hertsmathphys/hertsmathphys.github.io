title = "What can abelian gauge theories teach us about kinematic algebras?"
abstract = "The last twenty years or so have given rise to an interesting relationship (known as the double copy) at the level of scattering amplitudes between non-abelian gauge theories (such as Yang‚ÄìMills theory) and quantum gravity theories. After half a decade, this duality was seen to be present in classical physics for exact solutions in classical Yang‚ÄìMills theory and general relativity. Arising from the Double Copy, the phenomenon of <abbr title='Bern‚ÄìCarrasco‚ÄìJohansson'>BCJ</abbr> duality implies that gauge theories are more complex than previously thought. They are now known to possess an abstract kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non‚Äêabelian gauge theories, such that one typically works outwards from well‚Äêknown examples. In this talk, we explore using simpler abelian gauge theories to clarify our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well‚Äêdefined subalgebras of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subalgebras, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory. This talk will be based on work done in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10750'>arXiv:2401.10750</a>. <a href='2024-09-25-Armstrong‚ÄêWilliams.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In particular, the quadratic action gives rise to an elliptic complex, similar to the symplectic cohomologies of Tseng and Yau, but where the Beltrami differential of the large complex structure modulus plays the role of the symplectic form."

abstract = "Every bundle on a manifold has a universal symmetry group: for any Lie group <math><mi>ùê∫</mi></math>, giving a <math><mi>ùê∫</mi></math>‚Äêequivariant structure on the bundle is equivalent to giving a Lie group homomorphism from <math><mi>ùê∫</mi></math> to this universal symmetry group. The existence of non‚Äêtrivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‚Äêversion of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher <math><mo>U</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‚Äêbundles, or <math><mi>ùëõ</mi></math>‚Äêgerbes.

abstract = "The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:<ol><li>Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour‚Äìkinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang‚ÄìMills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the ‚Äúdouble copy‚Äù of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang‚ÄìMills squared</mtext></math>!</li> <li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie‚Ä¶) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>ùêø</mi><mo>‚àû</mo></msub></math>‚Äêalgebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>‚Äì</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol><p>We shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour‚Äìkinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin‚ÄìVilkovisky action: assuming tree‚Äêlevel colour‚Äìkinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>ùëÜ</mi></math>‚Äêmatrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour‚Äìkinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the ‚Äúcolour‚Äêstripped‚Äù homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>‚óΩÔ∏è</mo></msup></math>‚Äêalgebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‚Äêlevel) colour‚Äìkinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn‚Äôt possible at the loop‚Äêlevel. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger‚ÄìLambert‚ÄìGustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony‚ÄìBergman‚ÄìJafferis‚ÄìMaldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‚Äêbrane models have tree‚Äêlevel colour‚Äìkinematics duality. <a href='2023-11-22-Borsten.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

abstract = "The data appearing in the Buscher rules for <math><mi>ùëá</mi></math>‚Äêduality, the Kalb‚ÄìRamond field and the metric, can be unified to a connection on a categorified principal bundle governing all geometric T‚Äêdualities. Interestingly, this picture allows for a direct extension to <math><mi>ùëá</mi></math>‚Äêdualities involving non‚Äêgeometric backgrounds. Before explaining all this, I will give a gentle introduction to categorified principal bundles. <a href='2022-09-07-S√§mann.pdf'>(slides)</a>"

title = "Higher symmetries: smooth 2‚Äêgroups and their principal bundles"
abstract = "A 2‚Äêgroup is acategorical generalization of a group: it‚Äôs a category with a multiplication operation which satisfies the usual group axioms only up to coherentisomorphisms. In this talk I will introduce the category of Lie groupoids and bibundles between them, in order to provide the definition of a smooth 2‚Äêgroup. I will define principal bundles for such a smooth 2‚Äêgroup and provide classification results that allow us to compare them to principal bundles for ordinary groups. I will conclude with some potential applications of these ideas to various areas, including string geometry, Chern‚ÄìSimons theory, and equivariant elliptic cohomology. This talk is based on joint work with Dan Berwick‚ÄêEvans, Laura Murray, Apurva Nakade, and Emma Phillips. I will not assume any previous background on 2‚Äêgroups or Lie groupoids."

abstract = "I will describe a class of structures, known as <math><mi>ùê∫</mi></math>‚Äêalgebroids, which arises as a natural generalisation of the ordinary, generalised, and exceptional tangent bundles from ordinary, generalised, and exceptional geometry, respectively. I will discuss aclassification result in the exceptional case and show how to obtain the possible fluxes/twists of the bracket. In the M‚Äêtheory and ‚Ö°B setups, the twists organise themselves naturally into connections and covariantly constant differential forms, while in the ‚Ö°A case one in particular recovers both the Romans mass and the deformation of Howe‚ÄìLambert‚ÄìWest. Finally, I will show how to use these algebroids to answer a question about the realisability of embedding tensors (providing a new perspective on the result of Inverso ‚Äô17) and to give a joint description of the Poisson‚ÄìLie <math><mi>ùëá</mi></math>‚Äê and <math><mi>ùëà</mi></math>‚Äêduality.

title = "Supersymmetry and Koszul duality"
abstract = "The pure spinor superfield formalism is a very general method to construct supermultiplets, and in certain cases, Batalin‚ÄîVilkovisky actions for them, using extra variables inthe form of constrained spinors. The main focus has typically been on thecircumvention of old ‚Äúno‚Äêgo theorems‚Äù against manifestly supersymmetric off‚Äêshell formulation of maximally supersymmetric models, such as <math><mi>ùê∑</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></math> super‚ÄêYang‚ÄîMills theory and <math><mi>ùê∑</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>11</mn></math> supergravity.

Nevertheless, many concepts discovered in the study of scattering amplitudes generalise to cosmological observables. In this talk I will describe some aspects of this program which I have recently been investigating such as the double copy, scattering equations, and soft limits, and will discuss how these directions are interrelated."

This construction provides a simultaneous generalisation of Hecke algebras of finite groups and of skew group algebras. I will explain some of the basic properties of these algebras, some results about their structure, and the relation to rings of invariants. I will also discuss the representation theory of these algebras and their homological properties such as global dimension. If there is time I will explain the relevance of these algebras to the study of quantum reference frames, and possible analogues of skew Hecke algebras for von Neumann algebras. This is based on work inprogress, joint with Leon Loveridge (University of South‚ÄêEastern Norway) and <span lang='pl'>Jan G≈Çowacki</span> (PAN Centre for Theoretical Physics, Warsaw)."

title = "Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re Geometry and the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations"
abstract = "Partial differential equations of Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re type have been shown to correspond to specific choices of differential form on the associated phase space. Furthermore, Lagrangian submanifolds of said space may be viewed as a generalisation of solutions to a Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re equation. Building from the observation that the Poisson equation for the pressure of an incompressible, two‚Äêdimensional, Navier‚ÄìStokes flow can be presented as an equationof Monge‚ÄìAmp√®re type, this talk introduces a framework for studying fluid dynamics using properties of the aforementioned submanifolds. In particular, it is noted that such a submanifold may be equipped with a metric whose signature acts as a diagnostic for the dominance of vorticity and strain. We discuss how this approach may be extended to fluid flows on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold and to higher dimensions, through the use of higher (categorified) symplectic geometry. We conclude with some comments on how this facilitates symmetry reductions and some open questions."
