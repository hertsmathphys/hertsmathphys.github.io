Inspired by initial experiments in geometry and string theory, we present a number of recent experiments on how various standard machine‐learning algorithms can help with pattern detection across disciplines ranging from algebraic geometry to representation theory, to combinatorics, and to number theory. At the heart of the programme is the question: how does <abbr title='artificial intelligence'>AI</abbr> help with mathematical discovery?"

The Heterotic‐Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non‐negative real parameter <math><mi>𝜅</mi></math>, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three‐form <math><mi>𝐻</mi></math> on a manifold <math><mi>𝑀</mi></math>.

I will present several structural results for three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons, providing the complete classification of three‐dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left‐invariant metric. Furthermore, I will prove that all Einstein three‐dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton, leaving as an open problem the construction of a Heterotic soliton with non‐constant dilaton. In this direction, I will prove that Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore they represent isolated points in moduli space that cannot be deformed into a soliton with non‐constant dilaton.

abstract = "Every bundle on a manifold has a universal symmetry group: for any Lie group <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>, giving a <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math>‐equivariant structure on the bundle is equivalent to giving a Lie group homomorphism from <math><mi>𝐺</mi></math> to this universal symmetry group. The existence of non‐trivial equivariant structures is usually obstructed. In this talk we modify this idea in two ways: we consider the infinitesimal version of universal symmetries and allow higher, or categorified bundles. These appear, for instance, in supergravity, higher gauge theory, more generally in geometry and topology. We will use a family‐version of the fundamental theorem of derived deformation theory to construct the higher, infinitesimal analogues of universal symmetry groups. We use this to provide a unified definition of connections on any higher bundle and an algebraic formulation of differential cohomology. This extends work by Baez, Schreiber, Waldorf, Kapranov and others. Here, the curvature of a higher connection appears as the infinitesimal version of the aforementioned obstruction to equivariance. We elaborate in particular on the case of higher <math><mo>U</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>‐bundles, or <math><mi>𝑛</mi></math>‐gerbes.

abstract = "The string of (possibly cryptic) words in the title will be discussed. Neither prior knowledge of, nor interest in, all of the terms is assumed. We hope there is something for everyone! Essentially, two currently pervasive ideas that we find interesting will be brought together:<ol><li>Scattering amplitudes are the most direct bridge between quantum field theory and particle collider experiments. They are also incredibly rich structures that provide deep physical/mathematical insights into the underlying theories. An example is provided by the colour–kinematics duality of gluon amplitudes. While in Yang–Mills theory the internal colour and spacetime Lorentz symmetries ostensibly live independent lives, it seems that they dance to the same tune in the scattering amplitudes. A consequence of this hidden property is that graviton scattering amplitudes are the “double copy” of amplitudes: <math><mtext>Einstein</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Yang–Mills squared</mtext></math>!</li>\n<li>Homotopy algebras generalise familiar algebras (matrix, exterior, Lie…) by relaxing the defining identities up to homotopy. The homotopy maps form higher products in corresponding homotopy algebra. A key example is that of homotopy Lie algebras or <math><msub><mi>𝐿</mi><mo>∞</mo></msub></math>‐algebras. The violation of the familiar Lie bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> Jacobi identity is controlled by a unary <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math> and ternary bracket <math><mo>[</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>,</mo><mtext>–</mtext><mo>]</mo></math>, which themselves satisfy nested Jacobi identities up to homotopies controlled by yet higher brackets and so on. They arise naturally and inevitably in a number of mathematical contexts, such as categorified symmetries. They also have deep connections to physics. Indeed, every perturbative Lagrangian quantum field theory corresponds to a homotopy Lie algebra, allowing one to move between the physics of scattering amplitudes and the mathematics of homotopy algebras.</li></ol>\nWe shall first review the remarkable correspondence between perturbative quantum field theory and homotopical algebras. We will then illustrate how the colour–kinematics duality of scattering amplitudes can be realised at the level of the Batalin–Vilkovisky action: assuming tree‐level colour–kinematics duality of the physical <math><mi>𝑆</mi></math>‐matrix, there exist an action principle manifesting colour–kinematics duality as a (possible anomalous) conventional symmetry. In homotopy algebraic terms, the associated homotopy commutative algebra (aka the “colour‐stripped” homotopy algebra) carries a homotopy <math><msup><mi>BV</mi><mo>◽️</mo></msup></math>‐algebra structure. This observation, in turn, allows for simple proofs of (tree‐level) colour–kinematics for a variety of theories, some old, some new, and progress in characterising what is and isn’t possible at the loop‐level. For example, we give a concise proof that the <abbr title='Bagger–Lambert–Gustavsson'>BLG</abbr> and <abbr title='Aharony–Bergman–Jafferis–Maldacena'>ABJM</abbr> M2‐brane models have tree‐level colour–kinematics duality."
